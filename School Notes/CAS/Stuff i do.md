What to design first?
- The classrooms? The whole layout of school? but how would i design the school layout without the dimensions of each individual classroom? wouldnt that just make it weird? and what if i design the classrooms first? The different cultures of the classrooms are so dependent on the feeling that the layout give them, claustrophobic corridors, linear and boring and drives you to kill yourself? HOW THE FUCK DO I MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS FIT TOGETHER FFS? 
- some sources to help with developing the school systems [1](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-divergence-of-Eastern-and-Western-cultural-and-Lye-Maritz/0bdb6bbfa3fe12fe83869cf261d3736fff3496ce), [2](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Contrast-of-Eastern-Versus-Western-Educational-Systems_tbl1_301920782), [3](https://angelxie.medium.com/how-does-collectivism-influence-asian-culture-36a1045b884b#:~:text=Freedom%20and%20individualism%20is%20deeply,instead%20of%20its%20individual%20members.), [4](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2017.00056/full), 
- ↑yeah just realized this could be a theme (westernization) of how to build school systems, by taking a fundamentally flawed system (US education) as an example to look up to, ending up with a worse fucking school. (A mix of strict education and highly competitive stressful academic life, and the pretentious and cunning tactics of enforcing)
- ↑could be a story about asian schools taking everything bad about the western school system and implementing it 
- Still have to figure out the divided sections of the school, whether i should divide by:
	- Culture
	- Intelligence
	- Rebelliousness
	- Age (highly likely)
	- Faction (Faculty/student)
	- Different things school brainwash to students (highly likely)
	- ↑all the above should be chosen carefully to be "metaphorically right" if it makes sense
- could also get inspiration from dont hug me im scared
