# Cas Meeting Notes
---
Pretty balanced, creativity is solid, shows in the game development activities
- Programs
- Activities are lacking
- Calesthenics are there but need more variety

2. Ludum Dare game jam
- He talked about the game jam and how it shows my growth

3. Balanced
- Learning outcomes are balanced
- However, one problem is that I chose too many learning outcomes for one single experience. This often prevents me from focusing on a certain aspect of the experience

4. Keep doing what I was already doing, reflection-wise, but do more activities and services and also their corresponding reflections frequently so it wouldn't come off as lacking

5. He'd pass me
- Mostly because I was already doing well in the learning outcomes and reflections, the reflection quality is also good. And I shouldn't fail just because of drifting away slightly
