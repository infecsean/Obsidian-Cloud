# Notes
---
Instructions: (while I speak 1-1 with each of you about your P2 summative):  

-   Watch the longer documentary. If you feel you need more context, watch the shorter one as well.
-   Make some notes on the following points:  
    

What is the central idea of the doc?  
What are some of the evidence and documentary techniques used in the film(s)?  
What concepts or vocabulary specific to the world of advertising are most notable?  Any examples come to mind?

1. 
Selling lifestyles instead of ideas: 7:00ish
Take away the choice of not watching the ad: 16:00ish

Big corporations selling lifestyles instead of products, redefining their brands to be socially popular. Selling the world.


2. 
Hypocrisy: At the mall part, where the mall redefine their image to be the "old ways" but still don't allow free speech.

Suppression: The mall part, where private security is used to fight people who rebel. The factory part, where companies hire young women because they are easier to control, have less ability to perform individual thinking.

3. 
Brand Tribes: 6:00ish
Brand Epiphonies: 800ish
Corporate censorship: 21:00ish

Brand tribe: people who identify themselves WITH a brand.

Brand Epiphonies: Using our own ideologies as marketing idea, to appeal to our ideas and use our own beliefs to control us. ex: Nike's slogan, "just do it", appeals to people's reluctance to initiate and our hesitation to do something. The brand has nothing to do with supporting our reluctance but inviting us into the brand tribe and so there is no real lose to Nike.

Question 2:
Reflection: Advertising (after you respond to the documentary "No Logo")  
  
  
How is **language** used in the **mass media** to **persuade** people of a certain **ideological** position?   
Brands identify themselves as "one of us" as if they are in the community of passionate people who genuinely fight for their ideologies. Brands profit off of powerful ideas.

Where do we see evidence of **persuasive language** in the media?  
Advertisements hooks the desires of the people, targeting their deepest desires and what they identify themselves as.

What are **philanthropic** ads or ads which appeal to **social responsibility** or use **guerrilla advertising** techniques?
Advertising their brand as generous and kind people who just want the same thing as the audience. By defining their brand and making it a symbol of, say, peace, people who opposes the brand therefore opposes peace, which is a nono. Total fricking misplay.
