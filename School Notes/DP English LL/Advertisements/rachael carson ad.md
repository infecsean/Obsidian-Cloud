Study the infographic.Do a GAPS analysis.  
Prepare some bullet points of how you might answer the guiding question.  
  
Guiding Question: How and in what ways does the infographic below use  
layout, as well as the interplay between words and images, to achieve  
its purpose?

GAPS
- Genre - Infographic
- Audience - General Public, people unknown about the impact
- Purpose - Educate people about the impact of pollution
- Style - Cartoony?

Guiding question:
- Imagery as supporting element: The infographic summarizes the book, and so some concepts would be kinda abstract, so images may support and contexualize the text
- Layout: Organized and clear (Progress at what cost, context, main ideas), subpoints are clear. Vertical freedom so that it naturally guides the reader's eyes down, following the headers and subheaders
- Cycles: bird dead on top, broken egg on bottom
- Tell a story without words
