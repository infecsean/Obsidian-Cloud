### AD 1

visual
- This is a sports drink ad, but that doesn't seem to be the main point. 
- Because of its unorthodox product presentation, the audience would gravitate towards the other non-product side of the bottle, which is all about the nature and sports
- whichever side they gravitate towards, it is promoting the benefits of sports
- Its eye catching emphasis on nature is really comforting to the eye, the graphics is also really good with this, almost as if the sports drink is blended into nature, and through the drink, the audience can access nature's beauty

texual
- clear message: we see purpose (notice how they dont say the purpose, using the audience's curiosity to look further)
- Consistent text: white text for messages, bolded text for important things. (sports, we see purpose)
- no mention of the actual product (mentioned in the visual): instead, nutrition. Makes the audience feel like they care more about their health instead of making money (like their motto)


techniques
- Differentiation: where others see product, we see purpose. While other companies only care about money, we care about the purpose of the drink
- Achievable goals: Better, healthier lives. (achieve superstrength or cure depression)
- Using fantasy: make audience want to have a healthier and perhaps even be one with nature
- Transfer: Using the appeal of nature, they sell their product by selling nature and health. Prioritizing the actual intention rather than the product, the audience will look for the product themselves.


Notable things after doing research
- This ad campaign "product with purpose" received 2 awards "best graphics" "brand purpose"

### AD 2
![[English ad 2.jpeg]]
- At first glance, this doesn't seem to be an advertisement, but more like an artwork. Upon closer inspection, it is actually an ad to raise awareness about trash in the ocean
- Using unexpected placement, trash is placed on the wall. Since humans actively seek order, people tend to notice things that don't belong.
- Discontinued around the world, available in the ocean. Satire because plastic doesnt just go away.
- People come seeking an unusual ad from cheetos, but come to find that things like these are what causes pollution
- appeal to logos
