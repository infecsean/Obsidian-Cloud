Field Of Inquiry: Culture, Identity, and Communities

Global Issue: The obstacles people face when discovering their identity

### Intro
- Define: People often feel uncomfortable discussing topics such as existence or identity, as not every question has an answer. This oral will be discussing two works that tackle different aspects regarding identity.
	- A literary work: RAGAD, a play by the british playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard, is a parody built upon two side characters in Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The obstacle being the existence of RAG being only RAG from when they came to existence, in Hamlet, to their end, in Hamlet, and their identity of RAG and not individuals.
	- The non-literary work: Who am I?, by the English writer and speaker Alan Watts, is a speech from a larger work, "The Tao of Philosophy", where he talks about different culture's views on identity and symbolic thinking. The obstacle being the limits of culture.

### Ragad
- Author: Tom Stoppard
- Author style: British Playwright and screenwriter, his works often contains the themes stretching from human rights, censorship, all the way to philosophical topics
- Broader work: 

- Character & Dialogue
	- RAG
		- Stoppard chooses two side characters, RAG, who are insignificant in Hamlet, but still tragically dies as a result of Hamlet's plot. They are the symbol of nobodies.
		- this technique effectively reminds the readers that they can represent everyone
		- Theater of the absurd
			- This play is built upon theatre of the absurd, it shares similar elements to other works such as waiting for godot, where it also has two characters waiting for godot, a play on word for god.
			- The genre of absurdism here is presented as the depiction of the events that happen between their appearance in Hamlet. No matter what they do between said events, doesn't change the fact that they will die in Hamlet.
			- ==Linking to the broader work==, Absurdity is shown right off the start of the play, where every time they flip a coin, it would be heads. Another notable example of absurdity is shown throughout the play, where the two characters make countless technological breakthroughs on their own, depicted comically and insignificant to emphasize how little they mattered
			- Through theatre of the absurd, Stoppard effectively questioned the audience's individuality, and whether their actions really mattered in the grand scheme of things.
			- Another similarity this play shares with waiting for godot, is the god character, the Player
	- Player
		- Through the central theme of finding one's identity, the Player is then logically, the "god character", He symbolizes wisdom, the all-knowing. 
		- As actors, they become masters of acting, switching between identities, out of anybody, they should be the ones who has the answer to the "who are we?" question asked throughout the play by RAG.
		- Yet in the end, when they ask him, one last time, "Who are we?" in line 38. He replies with "You are rosencrantz and guildenstern, that is enough"
	- Rhetorical Questions
		- ==Throughout the play==, questions are used not only to drive the plot forward, but also to remind the audience that this might as well be the questions that THEY are asking.
		- In line 15 in the extract, they ask "Which is which?". In this crucial, life and death moment, they still can't find the answer.
		- Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were not denied an explaination of their identity, their individual existence just wasn't significant enough to separate them. When the player says: "That is enough" in line 39, Stoppard introduces a whole new perspective. Rather than trying to find the answer to identity, maybe we can accept that there is no answer, and our existence may not ever be significant enough to change the world. This also connects to the genre of theatre of the absurd
		- ==Linking to the broader work==, This play on questions is also comically depicted earlier through a game that they played called "questions". Events such as these can effectively loosen the often difficult topic of absurdity and identity, and
	- Analogy
		- The boat analogy is presented through one of the philosophical monologues by one of rosencrantz and guildenstern.
		- "Where we went wrong was getting on a boat", this is an analogy for life
		- The boat analogy is effective because it shows the audience Stoppard's perspective on existentialism through the two characters. That life is like a boat, and we are the passengers. It mentions that life is carried by the wind and current, out of our control.
		- He uses this in relation to the genre of theatre of the absurd, that no matter what they do within their boat, they have no control over their fate in this absurd world.

### Who am I?
- Author: Alan Watts
- Author Style: He is one of the first to interpret eastern thinking for a western audience
- Body of work: Other speeches which also touches upon his view on life and philosophy
- Bullet Points:
	- Metaphors
		- He uses metaphors to simplify his argument so the audience 
		- "this whole sensation that we are brought up to have of being an island of consciousness locked up in a bag of skin"
			- Conveys his understanding of collective public view of identity, that we are raised to understand that what defines us, is our body. Use of "Locked up" makes it seem that we are restrained within our body
			- He conveys that the audience's way of thinking is an obstacle formed by how they were raised, and presents his own view to the audience.
		- "Supposing this world is a tree. Are you leaves on its branches or are you a bunch of birds that settled on a dead old tree?" 
			- He uses this metaphor of a tree to ask the audience about their identity, in the context of this metaphor. This kind of direct questioning allows the audience, whether or not they have thought of identity, to rethink, within this context of a metaphor.
		- "being born into" and "being born out of" the world reveals the dichotomy between his audience's way of thinking, and a new way of thinking
			- He examines this way of thinking, and through this example, he brings out his argument that it creates an "estrangement" between us and the external world.
			- By understanding the other side of the argument, he acknowledges that there are other ways of thinking, which effectively allows the audience to listen to his side of the argument.
	- diction
		- When talking about Western culture, he uses words like "artifact" and "Book of Genesis" as a reference to religion and how Western culture is shaped by religion.
			- He emphasizes the way that Western culture thinks through the use of repetition "all things – all events, all people, all mountains, all stars, all flowers, all grasshoppers, all worms, everything – are artifacts; they have been made." on line 25
		- In contrast with Chinese Culture, which, ==linking to his body of work==, he has the professional background that allows him to understand the different ways that people think of identity in different cultures and thus share different views with his audience.
		- He juxtaposes the Chinese way of thinking, through presenting a western perspective, one that his audience is familiar with, and extending from that, how a Chinese child would react to it. He says that a Chinese child think of nature as something that is not created, but grown. 

- Conclusion
	- Ultimately, the struggle of discovering one's identity presented in the play is shown through Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and their journey of searching for individuality. Stoppard masterfully uses the genre of TofA, expressing the obstacles of trying to find oneself in an absurd world.
	- Whereas Alan Watts, through his way of words, presents different views on identity to his Western audience, acknowledging the Western way of thinking and conveying the Eastern way of thinking about identity through contrasting between the two viewpoints
