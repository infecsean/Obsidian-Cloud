Field Of Inquiry: Culture, Identity, and Communities

Global Issue: The obstacles people face when discovering their identity

### Intro
- Define: People often feel uncomfortable discussing topics such as existence or identity, as not every question has an answer. This oral will be discussing two works that tackle different aspects regarding identity.
	- A literary work: RAGAD, a play by the british playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard, is a parody built upon two side characters in Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Combining the comedic nature of parodies and the unique singular identity of these two seemingly individual characters, Stoppard masterfully sugarcoats the difficult topic of individual identity behind the story of RAG's journey.
	- The non-literary work: Who am I?, by the English writer and speaker Alan Watts, is 
	- the author presents a lecture on his perspective of identity, discussing not only his own views, but also a view that resembles more of a public opinion.

### Ragad
- Author: Tom Stoppard
- Author style: British Playwright and screenwriter, his works often contains the themes stretching from human rights, censorship, all the way to philosophical topics
- Broader work: 
- Bullet Points:
	- Genre
		- Theater of the absurd
			- Where the characters' actions serve only to show that their existence can't be changed. In this case, rosencrantz and guildenstern's determination to find their identity 
			- Linking to the broader work, Stoppard uses this style of writing to his advantage, and throughout the play, we see that the two characters make countless technological breakthroughs on their own, depicted comically to emphasize that it is absurd
	- Symbolism
		- The player
			- Leader of a group of traveling actors, he is the player. 
			- Symbol of wisdom and the all-knowing, Though he exists in the play, he represents the showrunner of this show. In other words, the film crew. He emerges illogically and serves often only to drive the narrative plot forward as a result of RAG's often meaningless discussions. For example: (The PLAYER gets to his feet and walks over to his barrel and kicks it and shouts into it.)
			- In this scene, the player ironically contrasts with RAG, he seems to know what will happen to them. "PLAYER: You are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. That's enough."
		- RAG
			- A persistent question throughout the play is a question of identity
			- "Which is which?"
			- They can't seem to know who is ROS and who is GUIL, even till the very end
			- Using ironic humor of how RAG were never presented as individuals in Hamlet, he drives their plot of trying to discover where they came from and why they share the same fate
		- The boat
			- Stoppard uses this analogy of a boat, through dialogue, to discuss the topic of their existence and their identity.
			- The only flaw of this analogy is the first sentence
			- "Where we went wrong was getting on a boat"
			- Analogy of life, but we had no choice whether or not to get on the boat.
			- In the same way, ROS and GUIL ended up on the boat not by their own choice, but a bigger force that drives them.
			- Stoppard's discussion of identity 

- Stuff i wanna talk about:
	- The player, in the sense of how he's named, is the person who knows it all, who knows that this is a script. They serve to set an ironic contrast between RAG and the world.
	- Boat analogy. RAG's discussion about life and how they creatively express their perspectives.
	- Humour. ⬆️. Using humour on RAG's end, it helps sugarcoat the existential discussion during the entire runtime of the movie.
	- Themes: Theatre of the absurd. Lost of identity. Fate.
	- Names: Stoppard plays on the concept of names, even as far as using them as a literal theme. idk if i should discuss the existentialism behind this little play on names like "why do we have names? do we define ourselves by our names?"
	- Questions (Rhetorical AND not): Thruout the movie they ask a lot of questions, in fact, i would say the majority of their wacky exchanges are composed of questions. Stoppard knows that, he ironically had them play a game of "questions"(not in extract). In the end, most of their questions aren't answered.



- Character & Dialogue
	- RAG
		- Symbolizes everybody, but just vague enough through parody since they are an already existing character, but also because of that, makes us think that they are, like us, existing.
		- Their struggles of discovering identity is different from ours because of their unique ambiguous identity being RAG.
	- Player
		- Symbolizes wisdom, the all-knowing. Though we know that he is one of the characters, he exists just to drive the narrative plot forward. He is, in a way, representative of the universe, as actors, they become masters of acting, and with such a central theme of identity, they should logically be the ones that know everything to identity, and therefore be logically the all-knowing.
		- Yet in the end, when they ask him, one last time, "Who are we?". He replies with "You are rosencrantz and guildenstern, that is enough"
	- Rhetorical Questions
		- "Which is which?"
		- Asked throughout the play, to not only remind the audience of the central thme of the struggle to find identity, but also ask the audience that question of "Who am I" or what can a name serve to the existence of a person, but just that, a name. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were not denied an explaination of their identity, their individual existence just wasn't significant enough to call for clarification. The player is the all-knowing, and that persists, because he knows that rosencrantz and guildenstern exists only in fiction, to be together, and die together. Their identity exists as rosencrantz and guildenstern. They were never "individuals" as we know them from Hamlet because they never gone beyond being RAG, only until RAGAD, that they were given individuality for this purpose. 
		- The struggle of finding answers to identity, became the struggle of accepting that there is no answer to such questions.
		- Linking to the broader work, This play on questions is also comically depicted through a game that they played called "questions".
	- Analogy
		- The boat analogy is presented through one of the philosophical monologues by one of rosencrantz and guildenstern.
		- There was one flaw in that analogy, in the first sentence "Where we went wrong was getting on a boat", this is an analogy for life, and life as we know it, isn't a choice. We don't get to choose whether or not to get on the boat, or in other words, to live.
		- This analogy otherwise sums up their sitation. If they are the passengers on the boat, then the wind and current is just that, the world. Stoppard uses this to his advantage, being a theatre of the absurd, they do seem too absurd to our world, but it serves to ask us the question: What if this isn't absurd?
		- Even as they accept that they can't change their fate, unless avoiding existence in the first place, they still can't accept that they are denied an explaination for their identity.
		- Stoppard ultimately still uses the last of their existence to ask the audience further: we can't change our fate, but can we at least change who we are?

### Who am I?
- Author: Alan Watts
- Author Style:
- Body of work: Other speeches which also touches upon his view on life and philosophy
- Bullet Points:


Stuff I wanna talk about:
- The nature of his speech
	- metaphors can be reinforced with tone to more clearly communicate abstract concepts
		- "island of consciousness locked up in a bag of skin" analyze this
	- He often includes the audience in the discussion on identity by using a more collective way of addressing selves"we".
- Humor
	- Sugarcoating the topic especially when it applies to everybody
- Switching of perspectives. From a collective Society POV, to his own opinions POV
- Rhetorical questions
	- provokes thoughts (but then again, other devices do this too)
- Play on words
