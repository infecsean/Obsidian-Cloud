Field Of Inquiry: Culture, Identity, and Communities

Global Issue: The obstacles people face when discovering their identity

### Intro
- Define: Struggles-> existentialism, identity

### Ragad
- Author: Tom Stoppard
- Author style:
- Broader work:
- Bullet Points:
	- Humor
	- 
Start with Genre parody -> Theater of the absurd -> other stuff
Define stuff: Existentialism
- Boat -> 
- "Which is which?" -> connect to the broader work, that this is a theme that goes throughout

Stuff i wanna talk about:
- The player, in the sense of how he's named, is the person who knows it all, who knows that this is a script. They serve to set an ironic contrast between RAG and the world.
- Boat analogy. RAG's discussion about life and how they creatively express their perspectives.
- Humour. ⬆️. Using humour on RAG's end, it helps sugarcoat the existential discussion during the entire runtime of the movie.
- Themes: Theatre of the absurd. Lost of identity. Fate.
- Names: Stoppard plays on the concept of names, even as far as using them as a literal theme. idk if i should discuss the existentialism behind this little play on names like "why do we have names? do we define ourselves by our names?"
- Questions (Rhetorical AND not): Thruout the movie they ask a lot of questions, in fact, i would say the majority of their wacky exchanges are composed of questions. Stoppard knows that, he ironically had them play a game of "questions"(not in extract). In the end, most of their questions aren't answered.
- {MAYBE} the contrast between the other people and RAG.

### Who am I?
- Author: Alan Watts
- Author Style:
- Body of work: Other speeches which also touches upon his view on life and philosophy
- Bullet Points:


Stuff I wanna talk about:
- The nature of his speech
	- metaphors can be reinforced with tone to more clearly communicate abstract concepts
		- "island of consciousness locked up in a bag of skin" analyze this
	- He often includes the audience in the discussion on identity by using a more collective way of addressing selves"we".
- Humor
	- Sugarcoating the topic especially when it applies to everybody
- Switching of perspectives. From a collective Society POV, to his own opinions POV
- Rhetorical questions
	- provokes thoughts (but then again, other devices do this too)
- Play on words
