# Standard Oil Co.
---

Global Issue: The unforgiving brutality brought upon poor countries by large corporations 

- Motif of bodies
	- Motif of bodies throughout the poem personifies the land, is described as a majestic being, resemblence of a god. It contrasts strongly with how Standard Oil is described, brutal.
	- L2 “Plunged its implacable intestine”
		- As relentless as mother nature is, standard oil still torn it down, demonstrating the brutality behind their actions. Through a gorey description.
	- L14 “However entangled the petroleum's arteries can be”
		- Standard Oil Co's disregard for nature shown as they not only neglect and disrespect the intricacy of mother nature, but also destroy it
	- L4 “Eyes of the ages”
		- The rich history it must posess, knowledge of the land
		- Juxtaposed with standard oil's brutal exploitation furthers Neruda's point of their disregard for humanity and history of the land
	-  Over the course of the poem, the reader develops a resentment for Standard Oil, with toreture-like description of mother nature, intended by Neruda.
- False god
	- Defeatist tone
		- Somber recognition of omnipotent power held by Standard Oil
		- Without explicit comments, it goes unquestioned
		- No anger, but disgust. Listing out the facts that speak for themselves. 
			- L34&36 “A president assassinated for a drop of petroleum,” “a swift execution on a morning mortal with light, petrified,”
		- Makes the audience realize standard oil's brutality, and those who benefit from suffering
	- Semantic field of paper
		- Example: Checks(L19), title deeds (L13), million-dollar mortgage (L35)
		- Not only do they disrespect mother nature, through destruction and exploitation, but they treat the product of their destruction as mere disposable pieces of trash, losing all its meaning beyond what they've given it
		- Mother nature is not only defeat, but meaningless, under the power of a new god, standard oil
- Striking Imagery
	- Gorey Depiction of mother nature
		- Personifies mother nature, we know how powerful mother nature is and what treasure it possesses, but also how vulnerable she is
		- Build it up, and tear it down. Organs plunged, arteries twisted, bowels moved. Pain that we can only imagine, pain that mother nature is experiencing.
		- Paraffin Foliage
			- Irony of combining chemicals with "foliage", artificial life is life repurposed for human consumption and entertainment
	- Contrast between the oppressors and South Americans
		- L21 Obese emperors
			- “smiling assassins” L22. Cold-blooded murderers who enjoys the benefits
			- Find buying “countries, people, seas, police, county councils,” easier than buying “silk, nylon, cigars” L23-25
		- L29 “Clothes them in uniforms” “designates which brother is the enemy
			- the loss of their personal integrity, national identity, and family loyalties
		- Juxtaposition reveals the plight of south americans under big corporation's oppression
