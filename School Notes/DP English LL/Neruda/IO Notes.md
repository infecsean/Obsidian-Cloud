Global Issue: The unforgiving brutality that is wreaked upon poor countries by large corporations for their resources

Motif of bodies
from daniel:

- Motif of the body
	- L2 “Plunged its implacable intestine”
		- Even being as strong as an “implacable intestine,” the drill still managed to plunge and destroy the mother nature
		- Reveals the cruelty of Standard Oil Company
	- L14 “However entangled the petroleum's arteries can be”
		- Reveals the company’s disregard for nature since the company not only neglected and disrespected the intricacy of the mother nature, but also destroyed it
	- L4 “Eyes of the ages”
		- A symbol of collective learning and experiences
		- By later juxtaposing the historical aspects of the land with the company’s cruel exploitation of nature, Neruda further reveals the company’s disregard for the humanity and the history of the land
	- The motif of the body personifies the land, giving nature a persona that is rich in history and humanity. And by later on revealing how the company has destroyed this precious land, the readers will develop a hatred for the company, which is exactly what Neruda expected to achieve.
