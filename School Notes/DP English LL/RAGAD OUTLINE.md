### Introduction
- The form and content usually reveal the cultural context both within the story and historical setting. Through the presentation of different narratives, style, and content, authors are able to convey their personality and context through their work. 
- Introduce the authors
- lead into the general ideas you gon talk about in the essay (what the authors used)


### Analysis
- Topic sentence, summarize the context in one short sentence, connecting to the question
- Provide contexual evidence taken from the book, take an example from book
- Restate the claim in the context of the book, slight evaluation of the effect.
- Topic sentence (claim), example from book, compare and contrast, restate claim with evaluation


### Analysis1 narrative
- both texts, while existing in the same timeline and using the same narrative. Hamlet's narrative being in the perspective of hamlet, and rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead in the perspective of R&G. Something that both have in common is death of the mc.
- While hamlet is a conventional drama that is structured to tell the story of hamlet develop the plot around the character, RAGAD is an absurdist drama that tells the story of hamlet based on the development of RAG, and so RAG are then free when the plot doesnt converge. This also has an effect on the audience, as hamlet is closer to the actions, and in response has more effect on the plot, while RAG are only involved when Hamlet's script has them involved.
- Hamlet: Hamlet tells the story of himself and his inner conflicts, whilst revealing the questions of life and death. In one of his solliloquies he said: now might i do it pat, now he is praying, but later realizes that he would be sending claudius to heaven, and backs away. 
- RAGAD: When their plots do not converge, meaning when RAG arent involved in the hamlet script, they are free to do anything, such as having philosophical conversations, or discuss things that are not in hamlet but are free to interpretation,such as how hamlet escaped with pirates.

### Analysis2 Drives
- While the two texts are written in different perspectives, the plot is driven differently. 
- Both texts are driven by mortality. But hamlet explores the persective where there is a way to make meaning out of life and have an effect on the world. While RAG explores the perspective where there is no meaning and everything is decided by random.
- Symbolism
- Hamlet: Rosemaries and pansies to laertes for rememberance. Fennel and Columbine to Claudius for faithlessness. Rues for the queen and herself, symbolize bitterness. Daisies for innocence, which she handed out none. Violets which symbolize faithfulness, whithered when her father died.
- RAGAD: the coin, representing their fate, Boat, representing the journey.
- "We can change direction, rattle about, but out movement is contained in a larger one that carries us along"

### Analysis 3 Character conflict
- Both are based on the characters' inner conflict, but have different views on their life. The conflicts are portrayed in different forms as well.
- While hamlet expresses his conflict thru soliloquoies, as a burst of emotions that says everything with no consequences
- Hamlet: Whether his life is truely worth living, 
- "To be or not to be, that is the question"
- RAG expresses their conflict by conversation, almost like solliloquoies but with a comedic effect. They often question their fate and existence which they still dont understand, whether their life is already written down, and their fate is already determined.
- RAGAD: "Who are we that so much should converge on our little deaths?"
- Thru hamlet's solliloquoies and RAG's existentialist conversations, we understand more about the characters' struggles and conflicts
