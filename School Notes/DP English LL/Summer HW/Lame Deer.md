### Stuff I Really like
- P.37, Line 7 | "The bald eagle is your symbol. You see him on your money, but your money is killing him. When people start killing off their own symbols they are in a bad way."
	- This is underappreciate, "they are in a bad way" like what? its like saying "you are in a bad situation" to an IB student who hasnt started their EE yet
- P.91, Last paragraph | "One man's shrine is another man's cemetary"
