Genre: Online blog/article
Audience: Subscribers of the magazine, skateboarders community

Style: Oriented towards commentary and opinions

### Tone
- Informal and non-academic
- at times, satirical, to make a point criticizing big corporations
	- When he describes the "life of ryan" whose life is undeniably good, but reality TV portrays it otherwise to match the "skateboarder" persona; he uses the word "boohoo", this is used to convey fake sympathy, since the life of ryan is obviously not based on reality.
	- This establishes the author's stance on the matter, against sheckler and against big corporations that exploited the skateboarding culture for money

### Imagery
- Figurative Imagery is used to evoke a sense of nostalgia or make audience remember the feeling
- "doing it for the thrill, passion and the feeling of bombing a hill at 6 am to grab a coffee"
	- This detailed description of a specific scenario can evoke a sense of nostalgia in the audience who has similar experiences, or others who wish to feel that
	- This helps the auther connect with the audience by establishing a common ground as skaters
- "lived in crammed apartments with 6 or 7 friends skating to survive"
	-
