# Why stuff is not salvation
---

Guiding Question: Explore how the writer develops their argument about the problem of consumerism in America.

Thesis:
In the essay, "Why stuff is not salvation", Anna Quindlen discusses the American society and its culture surrounded by consumerism.

1. Reasoning
- Statistics as logos isn't about logic based reasoning here. There is no logic in consumerism, like with why smokers smoke, sure they could not know the consequences, but its mostly addiction, there is no thinking in the act of consuming, much like smoking.
- Statistics here is rather being used to point out ironic facts. Its used to make a point, it is rarely being elaborated upon, it is always placed on the last sentence.

>By 2010 Americans will be a trillion dollarsin the hole on credit-card debt alone.

>A person in the United States replaces a cell phone every 16 months, not because the cellphone is old, but because it is oldish.

>Forthe first time this month, the number of people on food stamps will exceed the 30 million mark.

- Anecdotes
	- Father getting orange in stocking
	- Friend sayingwhy did we buy all this stuff? Did anyone really need a flat-screen in the bedroom, or adesigner handbag, or three cars?

2. Tone - informal
- Rather than directly addressing and criticizing the subject - Consumers & people who associate happiness with money. She addresses them in an informal, humorous way, and sarcasm does a lot of addressing them. We all know the facts, we all know that we buy useless things,
- Humor/Sarcasm
	- - "Yippee"
	- The depression before this one
	- (There's a holidaysuggestion right there.)
	- Now much of the country is made up of people withthe acquisition habits of a 7-year-old, desire untethered from need, or the ability to pay.


3. Comparisons
- invokes thoughts
- creates shock and informality to what would otherwise be 

- happy family vs not happy family

>If the mall is our temple, then Marc Jacobs is God. There's a scary thought.

>Ask people what they'd grab if their housewere on fire, the way our national house is on fire right now

>Every once in a while, like magic, a bit of extra money would appear. Interest. Yippee.
