In the article "Corporate Media's Double Standard: They Attack Whomever They Want, But You Cannot Criticize Them," Glenn Greenwald argues that the mainstream media practices a double standard when it comes to criticism. He claims that while journalists and news organizations are quick to criticize public figures, they become defensive and hostile when they themselves are the subject of criticism.

Greenwald provides several examples to support his argument, such as the media's tendency to dismiss criticism from non-journalists as "attacks" or "conspiracy theories," and their habit of framing any critique of their reporting as an attack on the free press itself. He also points out the media's tendency to defend itself as a collective entity, rather than accepting individual responsibility for mistakes or lapses in judgment.

Overall, Greenwald argues that this double standard is harmful to the public's trust in the media and undermines the credibility of journalism as an institution. He calls for greater accountability and transparency in the media, and encourages readers to think critically about the media industry and its practices.

Tone: The tone of the article is critical and confrontational. Greenwald is highly skeptical of the mainstream media and its practices, and his writing reflects a sense of frustration and even anger at what he sees as a lack of accountability and transparency. He uses strong and vivid language to convey his opinions and to engage the reader. For example, he refers to the media's behavior as "astonishing" and "egregious," and he uses phrases like "the media's worst instincts" to convey his sense of disappointment and disillusionment.

Literary Devices: Greenwald makes use of several literary devices to convey his arguments and to engage the reader. Here are a few examples:

-   Rhetorical questions: Greenwald uses rhetorical questions to challenge the reader and to make them think critically about the issues he is discussing. For example, he asks, "Why is it permissible to attack and condemn politicians, but when it comes to media stars, it is off-limits to criticize them?" This rhetorical question serves to highlight the double standard that Greenwald is critiquing.
    
-   Metaphors: Greenwald uses metaphors to make his arguments more vivid and memorable. For example, he refers to the media's tendency to defend itself as a "cult-like reflex of solidarity," which suggests that the media is more concerned with protecting its own interests than with providing honest and critical reporting.
    
-   Irony: Greenwald employs irony to underscore the hypocrisy and double standard he sees in the media's behavior. For example, he notes that many journalists were quick to criticize NBC News after one of its journalists made a derogatory comment about African Americans, but were less willing to accept criticism of their own reporting. This ironic contrast serves to highlight the media's double standard.
    
-   Hyperbole: Greenwald occasionally uses hyperbole to emphasize his points and to make them more compelling. For example, he refers to the media's behavior as "pernicious" and "destructive," which suggests that the media's actions are not just misguided but actively harmful.
