Themes
- Morality: I think Wild Thorns really touched upon some issues regarding morality, and really makes the reader re-think their judgement/opinion before committing to them. Such as in one scene where Usama is observing a conversation between a bread salesperson and a rich person,  surprised with the harsh truth and embarrased of what he had became to his people. Or another one where Usama said he was willing to bomb his own people to contribute to the cause, of course, my phrasing is really siding against Usama, but he really puts out a good argument against what is considered moral.

 TOK-Culture
 Q: In what ways do the characters and situations portrayed in the novel reveal the role of culture in the formation of knowledge?
 - Formation of knowledge here, in my opinion, means how the author wants to relay information about how things get around in the book. So with a focus on how culture is important in it, we have to first identify the culture. The culture here is mostly of the oppressed, and the culture that we get out of it, is that they are so deprived of everything, that they can only have faith, so naturally many things come down to religion. In this book, knowledge is formed on the basis that things can't get better and that they would only get worse should they fight back. Even in those who have the will to fight, the author will very often have them reflect and question their own actions and thoughts. The role of culture here, would then be a constant reminder and kind of an assumption that things are bad, and every action could lead to a bad outcome.

Post-Colonial Criticism
Q: To what extent can Wild Thorns be considered post-colonial?
- After world war 1, when the British left, the Jews and Arabs separated into Israel and Palestine. So that makes the Israel-Palestine conflict very much post-colonial
- In the book, colonial ideologies are shown in the Israel soldiers, they treated the Arabs as animals, and was very racist towards any Arab person.
- Wild thorn's representation of cultures is very one-sided, I would assume it's because the author is from Palestine, so that would be a reasonable explaination. However, that doesn't mean that Israel culture isn't depicted, just from the perspective of a Palestinian. They are humans too, and they don't want to hurt the people just for the sake of doing it, so in a way, they too, are oppressed.
- The way this book resists the empire is really unexpected, it doesn't depict the oppressors as evil villains that kill everybody on sight, and it also sympathizes with the oppressors. This book raises awareness on the topic and at the same time, educates the people of the culture.
