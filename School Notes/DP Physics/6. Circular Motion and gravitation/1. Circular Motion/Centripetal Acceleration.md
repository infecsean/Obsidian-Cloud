# Centripetal Acceleration
---
From [[Acceleration]], we know that when we change the velocity of an object, then ==it must be accelerating==, and the direction of acceleration is ==the same== as the direction of the change of velocity. 

If the [[Angular Velocity and Speed|angular velocity]] is $ω=\frac {Δθ}{Δt}$, and acceleration is change of velocity over time, and angle Δθ in radians is $\frac {Δv}v$, then centripetal acceleration:
$$acceleration=\frac {Δv}{Δt}=\frac {vΔθ}{Δt}$$
and so $$a=vω$$

substitute [[Angular Velocity and Speed#^9c0929|v=ωr]], $a=ω^2r$.
substitute again, with w=$\frac vr$, we get $a=\frac {v^2}r$.

since the direction of the acceleration is in the direction of velocity, it makes the angle between v and Δv about 90°, which means that ==acceleration is perpendicular to velocity==, and directed ==towards the center== of the circle.
