### Solid
A solid has ==fixed shape and volume==, so molecules have ==fixed position==.

==Intermolecular Force== act on molecules to pull them together, this force is due to the ==charge== of molecules. This force not only pull molecules together, it also prevents them from getting too close. It is responsible for the ==tension== of a rope.

==Molecules of a solid cant move but can vibrate==

### Liquid
A liquid has ==no fixed shape== but ==fixed volume==, so molecules are free to move.

It has ==intermolecular force==, its hard to compress, but weak asf if you try to pull them apart.

Liquid is hard to compress in a container cus it presses against the sides. The water below gets more pressure from the water above â†“.

So the per unit area (==pressure==), increases with ==depth==.

### Gas
A Gas has ==no fixed shape and no fixed volume==.

An object falling thru air it increases in momentum, so it must experiece a force, which is air resistance or ==drag force==.

### Brownian Motion
```ad-noone
Discovered by Robert Brownian in 1827. Page 98.
```
In a drop of water, small substances move around in zigzag patterns cus they are hit by invisible molecules of water. We dont see this in bigger objects cus they are hit by all sides so the effect cancels out.
