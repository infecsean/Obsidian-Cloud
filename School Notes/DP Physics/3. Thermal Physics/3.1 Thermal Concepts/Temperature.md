# Temperature
---
Temperature is used to measure how cold or hot a body is.

### Temp and KE
Liquid expand when temperature rises becus molecules vibrate more and move apart. Temp is directly related to KE, but not directly proportional to Celcius temperatures. The lowest possible temperature is when KE is 0, which is -273 Celcius.

As temperature gets lower, the molecules move slower, at the point where they stop moving, is called ==absolute zero==. Which is ==-273.16 Celcius==. This we call ==kelvin.==

So to convert from C to K, add 273. Por ejembre, 10C = 283K, 50C = 323K.

### Temperature and Molecular Speed
Now when temperature starts at absolute zero, the ==average KE== is ==proportional== to the ==absolute temperature in kelvin==.

Temperatures ==cannot== fall below absolute zero (No random Motion).

### The constant of proportionality
Is $\frac 23 k T$, where k is the Boltzmann constant, $1.38\times10^{-23}\:m^2kg\:s^{-2}K^{-1}$
