Normally, we use Q, to refer to heat transfer.

Heat always flow from ==high to low== temperature.

There are three kinds of heat transfer: ==conduction==, ==convection==, and ==radiation==.

### Conduction
Happens when in contact. Hot particles that are vibrating lose energy and the slow moving ones gain energy.
This is the concept of ==conduction==.

Metal is good conductor, cus the molecules are well connected and it contains free particles that can help move around the energy.

Gas is not good conductor cus they are far apart, but ==heat== is transferred to a gas by conduction, like how air conditioning works.

### Convection
Heat is transferred thru fluid.
When heat is given to the air, it expands, pushing the colder air aside, the hot air displaced more than its own weight, so it experiences an upward force. This is used in a hot air balloon

### Radiation
The way heat can pass directly between two bodies without a medium. It is called ==infrared==, and ==dark and dull bodies== emit and absorb them best. When you stand in front of a fire, you are getting radiated heat.
