```ad-definition
Latent means hidden
```

Amount of heat required to change the state of 1kg of a material without change in temperature.

When a matter changes states, the heat seems to disappear.

If it takes Q energy to change the state of mass m of a substance, then the specific latent heat would be:
$$L=\frac Qm$$
