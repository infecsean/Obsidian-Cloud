# The car example

In this example, the motor is doing work, but when the car is going uphill, it doesnt gain speed, therefore not gaining kinetic or potential energy.

If we visualize the air made of tons of molecules, we can see that the car is hitting the air particles. According to [[Newton's second Law|Newton's Third Law]], the car must experience an equal and opposite force. We call this the ==drag force==. As the car moves forward, it gives the air particles kinetic energy, we call this ==internal energy==.
