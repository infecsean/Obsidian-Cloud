### Internal Energy
- Describe Temperature change in terms of internal energy
	- Total Intermolecular potential energy + total random kinetic energy of molecules

### Temperature and Absolute Temperature
- Using Kelvin and Celcius & converting between them

### Specific Heat Capacity
- applying technique of specific heat capacity or specific latent heat experimentally
	- effects of cooling should be understood qualitatively

### Phase Change
- Change in terms of molecular behaviour, sketch and interpret the graphs
	- phase change graphs would normally be temp vs time or temp vs energy
