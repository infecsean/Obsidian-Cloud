# Specific Heat Capacity (c)
---
While ==Thermal Capacity== depends on the ==size and material== of the object, ==specific heat capacity== depends on the ==material== of the object.

Raising 1kg water requires more heat than 1kg of iron, so the specific heat capacity of water is higher than that of iron.

If heat ==Q== is required to raise temperature of mass ==m== of material by temperature ==ΔT==, specific heat capacity is:
$$c=\frac Q{mΔT}$$
