During phase change, ==KE remains unchanged==, only ==PE change== as molecules become more spread out.

Boiling only occurs at ==boiling point==, and occurs ==throughout the liquid==.

Evaporation occur at any time but only ==on the surface==. The fastest moving particles dissipate, ==average KE â†“==, temperature drops.
