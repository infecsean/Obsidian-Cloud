Internal Energy is the ==sum of total kinetic energy== (total thermal energy) and ==total potential energy==.

In ==solid and liquids==, there are forces between the molecules, so work is required to move them around, so ==their== total internal energy is made up of ==KE and PE==. No force between gas molecules, so no work needed to move them around, the total internal energy is therefore made up of ==KE only==.

==Kinetic Energy== is related to the random/translational rotational motion.
==Potential Energy== is related to forces between molecules.

### Types of internal energy: 
1. Vibrational Kinetic Energy
2. Translational Kinetic Energy
3. Rotational Kinetic Energy
4. Potential Energy

Vibrational and Rotational are for solid and liquids, translational is gas.
