# Heat
---
We know that temperature is related to KE in [[Temperature]], that the KE can be increased by doing work. The internal energy can also be increased by putting it in contact with a hotter body ðŸ¥µyes daddy. Energy transferred thru contact is called ==HEAT==.

When bodies are in contact heat will always flow from high to low place til they are the same temp. which we call ==thermal equilibrium==.
