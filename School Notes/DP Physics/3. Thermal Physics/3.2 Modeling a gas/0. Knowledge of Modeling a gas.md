Kinetic Model of ideal gas
- Be aware of the assumptions underpinning molecular kinetic theory of ideal gases.

Pressure

Equation for state of ideal gas
- Gas laws are limited to constant volume, temperature, pressure, and the ideal gas law.

Difference between real and ideal gas
- real gas approximates to an ideal gas when low pressure, high temperature, and low density. (Real gas behave similarly to ideal gas when high temp, low pressure)
- basically, ==ideal gas== is based on [[The Ideal Gas|some assumptions]] for ease of calculation and hence our suffering, where as real gas dont behave this way. (For example, real gas molecules have ==intermolecular forces==. )
