### Volume
Volume is just the volume of the container containing the gas.

### Temperature
Since gas dont require work to move, they have ==no PE==, just like MDID. And so then the Temperature of gas will be directly proportional to average KE.
$$KE_{mean} = \frac 32 kT$$

where k is the Boltzmann constant.

If there are N molecules then the total KE would just be:
$$N\times KE_{mean} = \frac 32 NkT$$

We can simplify this down to KE = $\frac 32$nRT,  where ==R is molar gas constant==, and ==n is number of moles==.

### Pressure
Pressure is directly related to the KE of particles and the temperature of gas.
