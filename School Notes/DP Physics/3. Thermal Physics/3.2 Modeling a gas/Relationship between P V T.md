Normally, we would have a graph to represent relationships, containing two variables. But here we have three variables that are directly related to each other. So we bring in three scenarios where each variables are constant.

### Boyle's Law (Constant Temperature)
P ∝ $\frac 1V$

As ==volume ↓==, gas becomes denser, cus molecules are pushed together, and hit wall more often, and increase momentum.

### Pressure Law (Constant Volume)
P ∝ T

As ==Temperature ↑==, Average KE increases.

### Charles' Law (Constant Pressure)
V ∝ T

As ==Temperature ↑==, molecules move faster, so pressure increase, however if constant pressure, then volume would increase in proportion to the change of pressure.

### Avogadro's Hypothesis
Equal volumes of gas at same temp and pressure have the same amount of molecules.
