Out of the three, gas has simplest model. Since forces between molecules are very smol, so they move freely.

This model makes a couple of assumptions:
1. Molecules are perfectly elastic
2. Molecules are spheres
3. Molecules are identical
4. No forces between molecules
5. Molecules are smol

Some of these arent even true, but we have to keep it simple. We call this the ==ideal gas== model.
