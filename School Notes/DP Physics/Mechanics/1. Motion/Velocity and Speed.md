# Velocity and Speed
---
Velocity: Displacement per unit time, vector quantity, unit $m.s^-1$.
$$ Velocity = \frac {displacement}{time} $$

Speed: Distance travelled per unit time, scalar quantity, unit $m.s^-1$.
$$ Speed = \frac {distance}{time} $$

$V_{average}$ is the total distance travelled over the total time (Assuming no constant speed)

Instantaneous Velocity: When you divide the travel into segments of say, 1 second, the instantaneous velocity is the velocity in the second at a given time.

```ad-note
title: Constant Velocity

If constant velocity throughout the whole trip, instantaneous velocity is all the same, instantaneous velocity = average velocity.

```ad-example
title: Measuring Constant velocity
Velocity = displacement/time
so displacement = velocity * time
```

Relative velocity:
