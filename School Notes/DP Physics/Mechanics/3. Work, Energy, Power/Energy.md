### Kinetic Energy 
- The **Kinetic energy** of a rigid object is its energy of motion and is defined as EK=1/2mv^2, where m is its mass and v its speed.
```ad-example
title: Example
An object going from 5 to 7 m.s and from 9 to 11 m.s has different kinetic energy, since $$\frac 12 * m * (7^2 - 5^2)$$ is less than $$\frac 12 * m * (11^2 - 9^2)$$

```


### Potential Energy
- Gravitational Potential Energy: Assuming that up is positive, the gravitational potential energy of an object will be -mgΔh, where m is the mass, g is the magnitude of the gravitational field strength (9.81 N.kg^-1) 


- Elastic Potential Energy: W = ΔEPE
```ad-warning
title: Assumptions
1. Height is constant (only one vector changes)
2. Frictionless
3. Constant Speed (No change in KE)
```
```ad-info
title: Hooke's Law

The magnitude of the displacement of the spring when stretched or compressed, is proportional to the magnitude of the force.
Can be written as $$|\vec{F}| = k |Δ\vec{x}|$$, K is the spring constant. Which is its stiffness (measured in N/cm)
```
$$EPE =\frac 12 k |Δ\vec{x}|^2 $$
