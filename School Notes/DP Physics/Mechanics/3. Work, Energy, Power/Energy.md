### Kinetic Energy 
- The **Kinetic energy** of a rigid object is its energy of motion and is defined as EK=1/2mv^2, where m is its mass and v its speed.
```ad-example
title: Example
An object going from 5 to 7 m.s and from 9 to 11 m.s has different kinetic energy, since $$\frac 12 * m * (7^2 - 5^2)$$ is less than $$\frac 12 * m * (11^2 - 9^2)$$

```


### Potential Energy
- Gravitational Potential Energy: Assuming that up is positive, the gravitational potential energy of an object will be -mgΔh, where m is the mass, g is the magnitude of the gravitational field strength (9.81 N.kg^-1) 
- Elastic Potential Energy:
