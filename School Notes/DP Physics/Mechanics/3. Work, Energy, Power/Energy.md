# Energy
### Kinetic Energy
- The **Kinetic energy** of a rigid object is its energy of motion and is defined as EK=1/2mv^2, where m is its mass and v its speed.

### Potential Energy
- Gravitational Potential Energy: Assuming that up is positive, the gravitational potential energy of an object will be -mgΔh, where m is the mass, g is the magnitude of the gravitational field strength (9.81 N.kg^-1) 
- Elastic Potential Energy:
