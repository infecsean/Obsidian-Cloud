# Friction
---
Static friction: Friction that stops others by the touchy ðŸ’§
```ad-note
title: Balanced Forces
Static friction balances the forces on by the object to the surface.
[[Newton's First Law]]: Applied force is balanced by static friction.
```

Dynamic friction: Friction that opposes the touchy 

F = Î¼R, where Î¼ is the coefficient of friction (dynamic and static)
