Gravitational Field
$$ F_G = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$
Electrostatic Field
$$ F_E = \frac{k_1 q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$
Infinity (for now): The point where gravitational potential/electric potential is 0

Potential Energy: The total gravitational potential energy of a system is the work done when bringing all the masses of the system to their present positions, assuming they were originally at infinity.

The work done in moving between two points in a field does not depend on path taken.
