# Centripetal Force
---
### Centripetal Force?
[[Newton's First Law]] states that an accelerating body will have an unbalanced force acting on it.

[[Newton's second Law]] states that the force will be in the same direction as the acceleration, implying that there is a force towards the center.

Since F = ma, we can apply [[Centripetal Acceleration]]'s a=$\frac {v^2}r$, so that F = $mÏ‰^2r$

### Circular Motion deduction
Since when the object is at constant KE, there is no work done. But since velocity is changing, there must be a force acting on the body. A force which ==cannot== be in the same direction as the motion, since it would indicate work being done and KE increase. So force must be perpendicular to the motion, towards the center of the circle.
