==Uniform Circular Motion== refers to circular motion at constant speed.
==Angular Velocity and Acceleration== is constantly changing.

While the magnitude of its ==velocity doesnt change==, the direction of the velocity is constantly changing.

The acceleration causing this motion is directed to the center.

When describing motion in a circle we normally use ==angular motion== rather than ==linear motion==.

### Time Period (T)
The time it takes to perform a circle
Unit: ==Seconds==

### Angulat Displacement (θ)
The angle swept out by the line slicing thru the center.
Unit: ==Radian==

### Angular Acceleration (ω (lower case omega))
The angle swept per unit time.
Unit: ==Radian s$^{-1}$==
$$ω= \frac {Δθ}{Δt}$$

The angle swept when full circle is 2π and the time taken is T.
$$ω= \frac {2π}{T}$$

### Frequency (f)
Number of complete revolutions per unit time.
$f=\frac 1T$
=>
ω=2πf
