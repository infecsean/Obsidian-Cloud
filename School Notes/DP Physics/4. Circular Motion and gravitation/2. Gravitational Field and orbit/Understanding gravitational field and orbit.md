# Understanding and stuff
---
### Newton's law of gravitation
- Relationship between gravitational force and centripetal force
- Spherical masses of uniform density by assuming that the mass is concentrated at the center

### Gravitational Field Strength
- Gravitational Force, Gravitational Field Strength, orbital speed, orbital period
- resultant gravitational strength due to dos bodies (restricted to points along the line joining the bodies)


# Add the rest later i guess lol fuck u
