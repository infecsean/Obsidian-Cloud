# Gravitational Potential (V)

Book: P.136

if you pick something up, you doin [[Work]] on it, which increases the PE, cus ==PE = mgh==. The PE depends on the ==size of mass (m)== and ==where it is (gh)==. We call the gh part the ==Gravitational Potential (V)==. We do dis cus we can know the PE of an object from just its mass, if we know the V.

Gravitational Potential is PE per unit mass:
Work done per unit mass taking a small point mass from zero potential to the point

In a room, the potential is proportional to the height, ==V = gh==.

### Equipotential & Field Lines
The amount of work done when moving up is ==potential x mass (ΔVm)==, but since work done is also ==force x distance = mgΔh==, ==ΔVm = mgΔh==, which gives us this:
$$g = \frac {ΔV}{Δh}$$
==potential gradient = field strength==.

### Gravitational Field due to massive sphere
Work done per unit mass taking small tests from position that wont affect the potential
