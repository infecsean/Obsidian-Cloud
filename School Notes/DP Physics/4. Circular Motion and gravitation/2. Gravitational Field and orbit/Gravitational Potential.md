if you pick something up, you doin [[Work]] on it, which increases the PE, cus ==PE = mgh==. The PE depends on the ==size of mass (m)== and ==where it is (gh)==. We call the gh part the ==Gravitational Potential (V)==. We do dis cus we can know the PE of an object from just its mass, if we know the V.
