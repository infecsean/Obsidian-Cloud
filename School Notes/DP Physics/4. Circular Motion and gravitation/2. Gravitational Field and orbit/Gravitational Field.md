what separates gravity from other forces is that it requires the introduction of a ==field==, which means that something exists in a certain region, which in this case, is gravity within the gravitational field.

### Gravitational Field Strength (g)
Unit: $N kg^{-1}$, Vector quantity
Force per unit mass.
$$g=\frac Fm$$
### Gravitational Field around spheres

Force experienced by m is: $F=G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$ , so field strength (g) = $G\frac M{r^2}$.
