### Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation
Every point of mass is attracted to every other point with a force that is ==directly proportional== to the product of their masses, and ==inversely proportional== to the square of separation. 

dw i dont know either

Say that this is two masses, Newton's law of gravitation says that
$$F∝\frac {m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
The constant of gravitational proportionality is: 
G = 6.6742 x $10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$
And so the equation would be:
$$F= G\frac {m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
