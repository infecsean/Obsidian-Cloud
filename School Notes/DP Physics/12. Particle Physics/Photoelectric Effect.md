- an e^- in a stable electron orbit will not emit radiation
- an electron that drops to a lower energy level will emit a photon (of fixed energy)
- the frequency of the emitted photon ∝ energy between the 2 levels (E=hf)
- transition is observed as a single wavelength in the spectrum

- Ψ psi (x, t)
- represents the quantum state (of an electron)
- everything we need to know about the electron
- *cannot be directly observable*
- it ceases to exist upon observation (? what the fuck?)

$|\psi (x,t)|^2 \delta V$ = probability density = probabolity of finding a particle a distance r from a chosen thing...

- in terms of $\psi$ 
	- a single photon or $e^-$ passes through both slits is everywhere on the screen until it's observed or measured
	- $\psi$ collapses upon observavtion
	- Nothing is real unless it's observed
	- Light behaving like a wave is a wave
	- Light behaving like a particle is a particle

It cant be found in a nucleus because the probability is 0 but can when r because it is higher than 0.

$\Delta x$ (where the electron is) $\Delta p$ (momentum) ((they are conjugate quantities)) $\geq$ ...

precision in one variable means a greater uncertainty in another variable.
