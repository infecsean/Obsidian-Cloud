# Impulse
---
```ad-definition
Name: Impulse(J)
Quantity: Vector quantity
Formula: J = F𝛥t
Unit: N*m
```
A net force acting on an object can change the [[Momentum]] of the object.

The application of a force to an object over a time interval is an impulse.

Impulse (J), average force F over a time interval 𝛥t.
J = F𝛥t = 𝛥p
[[Velocity and Speed|vector]] quantity, since it is a change in momentum, usually expressed in N*m
