# Conservation of Energy
---
The **total energy** of an object in a system is the sum of both the kinetic and potential energy.

The total mechanical energy isÂ constant at $E_{total}=E_K+E_P=\frac 12mv^2+mgh$, where v is speed.

### Law of Conservation of Energy
Energy can not be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another
