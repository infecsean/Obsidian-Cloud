# Collision P.82
---
Interaction between objects that involves a change in velocity (momentum).

Since collisions involve complex object deformations and large impulses, we will for now, focus on the objects right before and right after the collision.

We talk about three types of collisions here:
1. [[5.1. Elastic Collisions]]
2. [[5.2. Inelastic Collisions]]
3. [[5.3. Explosive]]
