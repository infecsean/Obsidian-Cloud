---
```ad-definition
Name: Momentum($\vec{p}$)
Quantity: Vector quantity
Formula: $\vec{p} = mv$
Unit: $kg*m*s^{-1}$
```
Momentum is represented by $\vec{p}$, and $\vec{p} = mv$

Momentum is a [[Vectors and Scalars|vector]] quantity with unit $kg*m*s^{-1}$

```ad-info
title: Definition
Newton stated in the [[Newton's second Law]] that, a net force acting on an object will cause a proportionate rate of change of momentum:
$$F_{net} ∝ \frac {𝛥p}{𝛥t}$$
```

And $𝛥P = mv_{final} - mv_{final}$
