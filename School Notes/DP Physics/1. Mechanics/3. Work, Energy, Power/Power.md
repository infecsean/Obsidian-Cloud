"how will power be measured?"

Power is the rate of doing work
Watt (W)
1 W = 1 $J * S^{-1}$

Power is calculated as:
	$P = \frac {work\:done}{time\:interval}$
	$\: = \frac {energy\:transformed}{time\:interval}$
	$\: = \frac {ΔE}{Δt}$

When work is done by a force F on a moving object with velocity V:
$P = Fv$
