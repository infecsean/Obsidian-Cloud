Î” - Example graph of price ceiling.

### Consumer Expenditure
Before PC imposed, ==Qe $\times$ Pe==, 20 x 8 = 160.
After PC, ==Qs x Pc==(Qd not possible cus no supply), 5 x 10 = 50.
Consumers spend 160 - 50 = 110, ==110 thousand less==.

### Producer Revenue (In this case = consumer expenditure)
Before PC imposed, ==Qe $\times$ Pe==, 20 x 8 = 160.
After PC, ==Qs x Pc==(Qd not possible cus no supply), 5 x 10 = 50.
Producers get 160 - 50, ==110 thousand less==.

### Consumer Surplus
Looks hard, but overcomplicated by cambridge.

Consumer surplus =
$$\frac{(Price\:and\:demand\:curve\:intercept - price\:consumers\:pay)\times Quantity\:Purchased}2$$
Without the PC, it would be a triangle, but with PC, it introduce welfare loss.
With PC, it becomes a trapezium (since there is no supply for the excess demand), to calculate, ((top + bottom)xheight)/2

Without PC: $\frac{(14-8)\times 20}2=60$.
With PC: $\frac{((14-5)+(11-5))\times 10}2=75$.

Consumer surplus increase ==60=>75=== +15.

### Producer Surplus
Producer Surplus =
$$\frac{(Price\:of\:producers - Price\:and\:supply\:curve\:intercept)\times Quantity\:Sold}2$$

Without PC: $\frac{(8-2)\times 20}2=60$.
With PC: $\frac{(5-2)\times 10}2=15$.

Producer surplus decrease ==60=>15=== -45.

### Welfare Loss
Just calculate b+d
