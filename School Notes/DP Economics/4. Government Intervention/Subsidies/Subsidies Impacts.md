Subsidies will move ==supply curve down==.
For consumers, they can pay lower prices.

In a, we can see that the price for consumers fall from Pe to P1, not P2, or that would be the entire subsidy.
In b, we can see that consumers can buy more at a lower price, ==total consumer expenditureâ†‘==.
In c, we can see the subsidy by the government, since the money has to come from somewhere, there is an opportunity cost. So government must take money away from other plans.

There is an overallocation of resources to the production of the good, Q1 is greater than the free market quantity Qe.

### Things that Government need to think about before granting subsidies
- Opportunity cost of this in terms of other projects
- Will the subsidy mean that firms would lose the incentive to produce efficiently, without the competition with foreign producers in a free market
- Who is paying the [[Indirect Tax|tax]]? Cus the subsidies might be granted to people who still need to pay tax, funding for their own subsidies?
- What damage will it do to foreign producers who do not receive the benefit?
