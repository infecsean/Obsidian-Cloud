# Tax Burden
---
Tax burden:
![[taxburden.png|400]]
Consumers pay their share of the tax, filled lines. They buy at a higher price.
Producers pay their share of the tax, filled whole. They pay government tax.

BUT THEY DONT ALWAY HAVE EQUAL BURDENS!!!

### Explained in cases
- When ==PED = PES==, burden is ==shared equally==.
- When ==PED > PES==, burden is ==carried by producers==.
- When ==PED < PES==, burden is ==carried by consumers==.

### When PED < PES
Meaning elasticity demand is ==smaller== than elasticity of supply
![[taxburdenpesmorethanped.png|400]]
Demand is ==unresponsive== to price change, so when higher price, ==Qd doesnt change much==. So consumers take up most of the tax burden.

### When PES < PED
Meaning elasticity demand is ==bigger== than elasticity of supply
![[taxburdenpedmorethanpes.png|400]]
Demand is ==very responsive== to price change, so when higher price, ==Qd changes a lot==. So producers take up most of the tax burden.
