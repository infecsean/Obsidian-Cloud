Before indirect tax:
Consumers buy at P\* with Q\*, producers sell at P\* with the amount of Q\*.

After indirect tax:
Demand curve no change. but== ==price consumers pay ↑==, so ==quantity ↓==.
Tax is Pc-Pp, or how much the tax imposes.
Producers receive ==Pc per unit==, they have to ==pay government Pc-Pp==, so they get ==Pp==.
