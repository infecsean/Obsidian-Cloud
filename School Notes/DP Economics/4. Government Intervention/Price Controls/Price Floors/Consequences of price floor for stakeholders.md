# Consequences of price floor for stakeholders
---
### Consumers
Consumers are ==worse off==.
They now pay more, while getting less.
Indicated also by ==loss of consumer surplus==.

### Producers
Producers are ==better off==.
They ==receive higher price==, while ==producing more==.
They are less likely to go out of business due to high prices, they get away with producing inefficiently

### Workers
Workers are ==better off==.
Employment increase when greater production

### Government
Government is worse off probably
When government buys excess supply, it puts ==burden on their budget==, resulting in less resources going to other desirable things.

### Stakeholders in other countries
Other countries often support their agricultural workers thru price floors.
Surplus is sometimes exported, leading to ==lower world prices==, due to the extra supply in world markets.
Low world price signal to farmers to cut production.
