### Consequences
Labour Surplus - Excess demand and unemployment. Usually involve unskilled workers.

Illegal Workers at wages below minimum wage - Often involve illegal immigrants who are willing to supply their labour at low wages.

Misallocation of labour - Minimum wage prevents the market from establishing a market-clearing price of labour. ==Industries that relies on unskilled workers will hire less unskilled labour==.

Misallocation in Product market - Firms that rely on unskilled labour face ==increase of cost of production==. => ==left shift of product supply curve==.

Stakeholders
- Firms (Employers of labour): Firms are ==worse off==, due to cost of production ↑.
- Workers (Suppliers of labour): ==Mixed==. Some ==gain== because they ==receive higher wage==, but some ==lose== because they ==lose their job==. In the graph above, jobs lost is represented by Qe-Qd, with additional unemployment of Qs-Qe.
- Consumers: Consumers are ==worse off==, since labour cost ↑=> supply of products↓. ==higher prices and lower quantities.==
