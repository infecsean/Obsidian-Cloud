# Consequences of Price Floors
---

### Surplus
Larger Quantity Supplied
Smaller quantity demanded and purchased than equilibrium price

### Government Action
Buying up the excess supply.

Had they not buy up, it would fall back to equillibrium, since farmers would have to sell it at lower price for it to sell.
- They can restrict production, but only some producers would receive it. (==Shift Supply Curve Left==)
- They can increase demand by advertising. (==Shift Demand Curve Right==)

### Government Decision for surplus
In general, anything government does to get rid of the surplus is problematic.
- Storing it: Cost of Storage + cost of purchasing surplus
- Export: Often require [[subsidies]], given to producers to lower the price since countries wouldnt want to buy at a high price.

### Firm Inefficiency
Firms with high cost of production arent motivated to produce effeciently since the high price protect them from low price competitors.

### Overallocation of resources to production
Too many resources are allocated to the production of a good, resulting in more than optimum quantity produced.

### Negative Welfare Impacts

- In terms of graph b, refering to graph a, if there was no price floor, consumer surplus = ==a + b + c==, and producer surplus = ==d + e==. Total social surplus = ==a + b + c + d + e==.
- Consumers ==-b -c== => a, Producers ==+b +c + f== => ==b + c + d + e + f==.
- Welfare loss is the surplus, ==f==, minus the part that the government buys, ==c e g==, which is ==-(c e g)==.
- Society would be ==better off== with less of the goods supplied
