### Consumers
Consumers ==partly gain, partly lose==.
![[welfareimpactsb.png|400]]
Back to this again, consumers ==gain c but lose b==.
"C is bigger than B so still win!" No, dipfuck, they have meaning.

+C, consumers who are able to buy at a lower price are ==better off==.
-B, some consumers cant buy at all, due to shortage. ==worse off==.

### Producers
Producers are ==worse off==.
![[welfareimpactsb.png|400]]
This is the same as the graph above.
Producers are forced to sell at lower price, so they produce less. and their revenue drops ==$P_e \times Q_e => P_c \times Q_s$==.
Also indicated by welfare loss: ==-d, -c==.

### Workers
Workers are ==worse off==
They fall in outputs from Qe => Qs, so they end up getting fired.

### Goverment
==No gain or losses==
May gain popularity as benefit from consumers who are better off due to price ceiling.
