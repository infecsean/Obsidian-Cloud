# Consequences of Price Ceilings
---
Suppliers are not willing to produce more than the price ceiling, leading to ==Quantity Supply ↓==.
Consumers are willing to buy at a lower price, leading to ==Quantity Demanded ↑==.

This creates a ==shortage==(Excess Demand).

# Shortages

![[Rise of illegal trade]]

![[Non price rationing]]

### Underallocation of resource
Society is worse off

###
![[Negative Welfare Impacts]]

### Government response:
1. Shift Demand Curve: To the left, until equilibrium point reaches the maximum price, but that eliminates the whole point
2. Shift Supply Curve: To the right, until equilibrium reaches the maximum price, however, this is good. The government can:
	1. Offer [[Subsidies]] to firms to encourage production
	2. Start producing themselves, ==direct provision==
	3. If government had stored some products, they could release it to the market, however, this isnt possible with perishable things (food)
	4. ![[breadsupplyshift.png|300]]
	5. However, this means government actually has to spend money, which creates an opportunity cost. Meaning giving up some support for others.
