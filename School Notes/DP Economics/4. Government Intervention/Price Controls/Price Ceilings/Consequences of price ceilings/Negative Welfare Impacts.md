- A graph of a free market, the consumer surplus and producer surplus is maximum, allocative efficiency is achieved.

- In terms of graph b, refering to graph a, if there was no price ceiling, consumer surplus = ==a + b==, and producer surplus = ==c + d + e==. Total social surplus = ==a + b + c + d + e==.
- After the price ceiling, consumer surplus => ==a + c==, and producer surplus => ==e==. Total Social Surplus => ==a + c + e==.
- After price ceiling has been established, the shaded area b + d, is lost, and is called ==deadweight loss==.
