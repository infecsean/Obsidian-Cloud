### WHY?
The free market does not always lead to an optimal outcome for producers, consumers, and the society as a whole, this directly relates to: [[Reasons of Intervention#^c10c92]].

### Important Outcomes
- Setting minimum prices
- Setting maximum prices

Results in: Market disequillibrium, hence shortages and surpluses.

### Difference From others
While [[subsidies]] and [[Indirect Tax]] set a new equilibrium point, price control dont allow a new equilibrium point to be established. -> Force market into ==persisting market disequilibrium==.

### Misconception
Why is the ceiling on the bottom and the floor on top? thats so counter intuitive.
Well, a [[Price Ceilings|price ceiling]] above the equilibrium price wouldnt be effective, since the market is already at equilibrium. Same goes for [[Price Floors]].
