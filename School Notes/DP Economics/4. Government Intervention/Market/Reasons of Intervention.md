1. ##### Provide Government with Revenue
	- The lower the [[Range of values of PED|elasticity of demand]] is, the more the tax revenue. Thru [[Indirect Tax]].
	- Hence indirect tax is mostly imposed on cigs, alcohol, addictive stuff
2. ##### Provide support to firms and low income households
	- Support Firms: Kickstart companies that the government want to support, such as eco-friendly power.
	- Support Low income Households: Households often dont earn enough income to afford all necessities. Government use ==subsidies==, ==price ceiling==, ==direct provision of services== such as free education. Also stuff like child support, unemployment.
3. ##### Influence level of consumption and production. Also thru [[Indirect Tax]]
	- Influence Consumption: Place tax on goods that are undesireable (==demerit goods==) to discourage consumption (like ciggies and alcohol). or beneficial things (==merit goods==) to encourage spending on them (education).
	- Influence Production: To support low income households, government can influence the market and decrease firms' output.
4. ##### [[Market Failure]]: 
	- failure of [[Market]] to achieve allocative efficiency. Meaning that the market produces more or less than what society prefers. Government can use ==[[Indirect Tax]]==, ==subsidies==, ==nudges==, ==direct provision of service== from the last point, and ==command and control== methods.
5. Promote equality: The market system does not achieve a fair distribution of income and wealth. Policies include ==price ceiling== and ==subsidies==. ^c10c92
