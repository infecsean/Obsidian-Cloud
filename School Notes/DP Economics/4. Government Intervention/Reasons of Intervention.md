# Reasons of Government Intervention
---
1. Provide Government with Revenue
	- The lower the [[Range of values of PED|elasticity of demand]] is, the more the tax revenue. 
	- Hence indirect tax is mostly imposed on cigs, alcohol, addictive stuff
2. Provide support to firms and low income households
	- Support Firms: Kickstart companies that the government want to support, such as eco-friendly power.
	- Support Low income Households: Households often dont earn enough income to afford all necessities. Government use ==subsidies==, ==price ceiling==, ==direct provision of services== such as free education. Also stuff like child support, unemployment.
3. Influence level of consumption and production
	- Influence Consumption: Place tax on goods that are undesireable (==demerit goods==) to discourage consumption (like ciggies and alcohol). or beneficial things (==merit goods==) to encourage spending on them (education).
	- Influence Production: To support low income households, government can influence the market and decrease firms' output.
