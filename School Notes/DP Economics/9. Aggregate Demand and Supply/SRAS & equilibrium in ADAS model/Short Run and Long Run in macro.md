o.234 c.277

The distinction between SR and LR doesnt matter for AD but it does for ==AS==

### Short Run
- Time period when prices are constant, in spite of changes in price level
- Doesnt change with price level
- especially true for wages and price of labor
- Wages don't change much in the short run because:
	- labor contracts have fixed wages for a period of time
	- minimum wage have fixed minimum wage
	- workers resist wage cuts
	- wage cut decrease worker morale, firms try to avoid


### Long Run
- Time period when all prices are flexible
- Changes with price level
