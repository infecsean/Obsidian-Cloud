- Similar with supply curve in micro, a shift is the result of a factor OTHER than the price level

### Wage
- Increase in wage will result in increase in cost of production for firms -> fall in [[SRAS]]
- Increase in wage, 1->3. Decrease in wage, 1->2

### Non-Labor Resources
- Increase of capital or raw material, increase cost for firms -> fall in SRAS
- Increase in price, 1->3. Decrease in price, 1->2

### Indirect Taxes
- Increase in tax, increase in cost of production -> fall in SRAS
- Increase in Tax, 1->3. Decrease in Tax, 1->2

### Subsidies
- Increase in subsidies from gov to firms, lowers firms cost -> rise in SRAS
- Increase in subsidies, 1->3. Decrease in subsides, 1-2

### Supply Shocks
- Events that have sudden and strong impact on SRAS
- Example:
	- Wars lead to destruction, lower production, left shift of SRAS
	- Weather conditions lead to fall in agricultural output, left shit of SRAS
	- Tho weather is not always bad, for example, rainstorm in drought i guess?
