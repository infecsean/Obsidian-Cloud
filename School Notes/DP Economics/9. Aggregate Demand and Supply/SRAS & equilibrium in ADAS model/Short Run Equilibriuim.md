![[ADAS curve 1.png|400]]

- The economy is in Short run equilibrium when the AD curve intersects the SRAS curve
- The output produced by the economy is exactly equal to the total demand, so there is no reason to produce more
- The intersection determines the ==price level==, the ==level of real output==, and the ==level of employment==

- At Ple and Ye, equilibrium is achieved.
- At Pl1, there is an excess amount of rGDP ==supplied==, putting a downward pressure on PL
- At Pl2, there is an excess amount of rGDP ==demanded==, upward pressure on PL
