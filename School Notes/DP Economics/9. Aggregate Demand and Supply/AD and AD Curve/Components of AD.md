### Net Export (X-M)
- ==Exports== are domestic goods bought by foreigners
	- Results in an inflow of export revenue
- ==Imports== are goods bought from foreign producers
	- Results in an outflow of import expenditure
- Net export is acquired by export-import
	- Can be positive, where export reveue > import expenditure, add to AD
	- Or negative, where import expenditure > export revenue, reduce AD

So, AD = C + I + G + (X-M)
