### Consumer confidence
- If people are optimistic for the future, they will spend more. ==AD shifts right==
- If they expect economic conditions to worsen, they will spend less. ==AD shifts left==
- Governments regularly measure consumer confidence to predict the spending

### Interest Rates
- When people want to buy expensive stuff they will borrow money from bank, and will have to pay interest later on
- If there is an increase in interest rate, meaning there is an increase in borrowed money, then there would be less borrowing. result in ==AD↓==
- ==Rise of interest rate== will lead to ==fall of consumption==. Vice versa, [[Ceteris Paribus]].

### Wealth
- Not to be confused with ==income==
	- Income is money that people earn
	- Wealth is made up of assets people own
		- ex. houses, jewelry, art
- Two main ways to change
	- ==Change in house prices==: If house prices increase, consumers will feel confident and buy more. ==House prices↑ = Consumption↑== 
	- ==Change in value of stocks and shares==: Consumers have shares in companies, when the value increase, making them feel wealthier. ==Stock value↑ = Consumption↑==

### Income Taxes
- When someone's income increase, so will consumption
- If direct income tax increase, people will have less ==disposable income==
	- ==Disposable income==: Income that people have after tax
- So when income tax ==increase==, consumption ==decrease==

### Level of household indebtness
- How much people owe from borrowing money in the past
- If people are in high debt, they will cut back on consumption
- ==High indebtedness== = ==Low consumption==, AD shift ==left==

### Expectations
- Spending may be influenced by what they expect
- If people expect future prices to fall, they will wait for price to fall
- Expected future price ==increase==, consumption ==decrease==, AD shift ==left==
