â†‘(a)A standard AD curve, (b) Demand curve in micro

### AD vs D curve
- D curve is for one market (micro), AD curve includes whole economy (macro)
- D curve has price of one good on y-axis, AD curve has average price level 
- D curve has quality of a good on x-axis, AD curve has total quality (national output)

- ==national output== = ==national income== = ==national expenditure==

Since aggregate means total, we need to look back at the concept in [[Calculating GDP and GNI]], CIG(x-m), see [[Components of AD]]

### Changes in AD curve
Shifting occurs when the different components are changed.
But when do they change? see [[Determinants of AD]] i guess
