# Implications of Keynesian and Monetarist model
---
c.293

### Auto-self-correct vs persistent deflation
- Monetarists say that the economy automatically corrects the ==inflationary/deflationary gaps==, returning to full employment equilibrium
- Keynesian say that equilibrium ==can remain== at a point less than full employment caused by insufficient demand

- Monetarists say that governments should make markets ==as free as possible==, so wages and prices can respond to forces of demand and supply, without ==gov interference==
- Keynesians say the government should ==intervene== to help economy to come out of deflationary gap

### Increase in AD â‰  Increase in PL
- Monetarists say AD ==increase== always leads to PL ==increase==. 
	- In short run, AD shifting right will increase both rGDP and PL
	- In the long run, AD increasing will only result in PL increase
- Keynesians say that up until the second phase of the AS curve, that changes in AD will result in changes in PL. When it is vertical, AD change will result in PL change and no rGDP change
