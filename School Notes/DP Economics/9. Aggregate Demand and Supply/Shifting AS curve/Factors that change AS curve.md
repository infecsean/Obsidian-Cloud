![[Shift of AS curve 1.png|500]]

### Increases in quantities of factors of production
- If the ==quanitity increase==, AS curve ==shift right==
- Example: A shift in quantity of physical capital or land means the economy can produce more rGDP

### Improvements in quality of factors of production
- ==Improvements== of quality shifts AS curve ==right==
- Example: Education, skill/health increase quality of workers. Skilled workers/healthy workers produce more than useless and unhealthy workers

### Improvements in technology
- ==Improvement== in technology shift AS curve ==right==
- Example: Workers who work with machines can produce more output at a shorter time

### Increase in efficiency
- When economy makes better use of scarce resources, produce greater quanity of output
- Potential output ==increases==, AS curve ==shifts right==

### Institutional changes 
- Often determines how effectively scarce resource is used (related to efficiency)
- Example: Private/public resource, competition, government regulation

### Reduction in natural rate of unemployment
- If decrease, economy is making better use of resources, increasing output.
- Potential output ==increase==, AS curve ==shifts right==
