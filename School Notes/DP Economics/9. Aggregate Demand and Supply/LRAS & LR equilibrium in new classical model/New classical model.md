# The new classical model
---
c.281 o.237

### Key principles:
- Importance of price mechanisms in coordinating economic activites
- competitive market equilibrium
- economy is a harmonious system that ==automatically== tend towards full employment
	- Note that ==Automatically== here means ==without government intervention==
These are disagreed upon when studying macro.
- They believe that there should be very minimum of [[Government Intervention]] in the allocation of resources
- This view asserts that ouput is based entirely upon the factors of producton and thus independent from price level

It examines what happen in the [[LRAS|long run]]. When all resource prices change to match the price level

### Why it is vertical
- Since wage is changing to match output price change, cost of production remains even as PL changes
- When firms' profit increase in the short run, in the long run, wages will rise the same amount, essentially nothing has changed, so there is no incentive for firms to change the quantity of output
