# Deflationary/Inflationary gaps
---
c.282 o.243
```ad-tldr
Deflationary/inflationary gaps represent short run equilibrium positions in an economy.
Deflationary Gap: rGDP<potential GDP. Unemployment>Natural unemployment. Insufficient Demand.
Inflationary Gap: rGDP>potential GDP. Unemployment<Natural unemployment. Excess Demand.
Full Equilibrium: No inflationary/deflationary gap

What happens when AD and SRAS intersect on a point thats NOT LRAS?

![[deflationary gaps and inflationary gaps.png]]
### Potential Output
- Picture C above
- Where unemployment is equal to the natural rate of employment
- And there is no inflationary/deflationary gap

### AD Fall
![[deflationary gap.png|300]]
- When AD falls, there is a ==deflationary(recessionary) gap==.
- Unemployment is greater than the natural rate of unemployment
	- There is not enough ==total demand== to make firms want to produce more
	- Meaning firms need less labor -> unemployment
- At p2, there is not enough rGDP from the [[Components of AD|ppl]] to meet the potential GDP
- This means that firms' cost of [[Determinants of SRAS|production falls]]
- result in rightward shift of SRAS
- the final result is the same rGDP at a lower price

### AD rise
![[inflationary gap.png|300]]
- When AD rises, there is an ==inflationary gap==
- Unemployment is less than natural rate of unemployment
	- There is ==too much demand== and firms have to produce more
	- Meaning firms need more labor -> employment
- As employment increase, firms start to [[New classical model|compete]] for increasingly scarce labor
- With an [[Determinants of SRAS|increase in cost of production]], SRAS shifts left
- Although firms are willing to produce more for the high prices in the short run, there is no real gain in the long run.
- The final result in the same output at a higher price
