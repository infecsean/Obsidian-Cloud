[[Approaches to measuring national income]] useful source

1. 
- The income method calculates the national income by adding up the value of all income earned in the economy by the factors of production over a time period. For example, rent earned by land, interest earned by capital, profits earned by entreprenuership. 
	- The advantage of this method is its clear information on relative income shares of different factors of production, how they change over time, and also allows comparison over other countries.
	- The disadvantage of this method is that it doesn't consider some factors that are required to calculate the GDP, so it is inferior to other methods when calculating GDP
- The output method calculates the national output by measuring the value of all final goods and services produced over a time period. It usually separates production into sectors: agrigultural, manufacturing, service. The data is then summed up to calculate for the total value for output in the economy
	- The advantage this method it allows for studying performance of each sector through its relative share, how it changes over time, and also allows comparison over countries
- The expenditure method calculates national expenditure by adding up the value of all spending on final goods and services in an economy. This is done by breaking the economy into different sectors: Consumer spending, firm Investment, Government spending, and net export (export minus import). Since exports are produced within the country, it should be included in calculation, and imports are produced outside of the country, so it should not.
	- The advantage of this method is that it allows for analyzing each component of the GDP and their relative contribution, how they change over time, and make comparisons over countries.

Explain why auto-adjustment happens.
![[LRAS and SRAS in new classical.png|300]]
![[inflationary gap.png|300]]
In the new classical model, the economy is viewed from two aspects: The short run, where resource price and wages don't change with price change. And the long run, where resource price and wages change along with price levels. This principle assumes that the economy will automatically adjust back onto the potential output, automatically meaning without or with minimum government intervention. At the start, we assume the economy is already at its potential output, meaning AD and SRAS intersects at the LRAS vertical line. If there is an increase in AD (AD1->AD2), there is an inflationary gap, and unemployment is less than the natural rate of unemployment, there is excess demand and firms have to increase production, increasing employment. As employment increase, firms start to compete for increasingly scarce and therefore expensive labor. Leading to increase in cost of production, so SRAS decreases (SRAS1->SRAS2), and the economy is back on the potential output, but at a higher price. The same thing happens for when AD decreases. In the end, the economy will auto-adjust back onto the potential output, and any effort firms put to try to increase output in the short run will result in no real gain in the long run.

Explain why the economy gets stuck in recession
![[keynesian model.png|400]]
In the Keynes model, unlike the new classical model, there isnt an auto-adjustment mechanism, nor is it broken into long and short run. Instead, they believe that an economy itself would not be able to auto-adjust to potential output, 

The Keynes model corrects some of the assumptions in the new classical model, in the graph shown above, AD decreased, resulting in a deflationary gap, and equilibrum is less than full unemployment. Keynes argues that firms would lower the output but keep price level constant, rather than lowering the price level, due to low demand. 


### Bonus Question
1. Potential output is the amount of output produced when the economy experiences full employment, meaning the employment is equal to the natural rate of unemployment. Where there will still be people that are unemployed, including people who are moving between jobs, locations, training to get a different job, or just temporarily uemployed due to seasonal unemployment.
