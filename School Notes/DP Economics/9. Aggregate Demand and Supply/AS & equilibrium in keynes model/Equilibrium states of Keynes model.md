# Kanye model equilibrium

c.288 o.244

The equilibrium level of output depends mainly on the level of [[Aggregate Demand (AD)|AD]] 

### Below full employment
![[Keynesian AD 1.png|400]]
- Aggregate demand can increase such that output increases without price level increasing.
- This is due to spare capacity
- Thus, there is no inflationary pressure

### Closing up to full employment
![[Keynesian AD 2.png|400]]
- Starts to experience inflationary pressure
- Factors of production become scarce
- Price level increases to compensate producers for higher costs

### Full Employment ðŸ’ª
![[Keynesian AD 3.png|400]]
- If at full employment and there in an increase in AD
- ==Pure inflationary==
- There is no increase in output, only in price level
- Cant increase output any more in the long run

### Keynesian model conclusion
- The economy can be ==indefinitely stuck== in a deflationary gap.
	- In [[New classical model|new classical]], it ==automatically returns== to full employment equilibrium
- Increases in [[Aggregate Demand (AD)|AD]] ==does not necessarily increase== price level
	- In new classical, it ==always result== in higher price level
