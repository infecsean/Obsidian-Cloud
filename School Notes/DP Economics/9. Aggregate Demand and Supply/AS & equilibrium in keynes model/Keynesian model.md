The Keynesian model does not separate into short run and long run, instead, 3 sections
### Phase 1:
- Price level remains constant as rGDP increases
- AS curve is ==perfectly elastic== at low levels of economic activity
- Spare capacity allow firms to produce more without higher costs
	- Unused labor and unutilized capital

### Phase 2:
- Price level increases with rGDP increase
- Economy reaches potential output and ==spare capacity== is used up
- Producers bid for increasingly scarce resources, price level rises to compensate for high costs
- At ==Yp==, economy is at potential output, unemployment falls and is equal to the natural rate of unemployment

### Phase 3:
- As AS becomes vertical at ==Ymax==, GDP reaches a point where it cant increase anymore
- It is impossible to increase output since all factor of production is fully employed
- AS is now ==perfectly inelastic==
- Any attempt to increase their output results in a higher price
