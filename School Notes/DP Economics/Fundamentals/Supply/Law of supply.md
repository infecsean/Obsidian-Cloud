# Law of Supply
---
-   "As the price of a product rises, the quantity supplied of the product will increase, [[ceteris paribus]]."
-   The change in the price of a product will lead to a change in the quantity supplied of the product.

Vertical Supply Curve: In some situations, you can't produce more of a product even with more time.

1.  The Short Run: When at least one factor is fixed and cannot be changed by the firm. Relative to how long it takes for firms to produce a product, the short term is when firms can't change the quantity produced quickly.
2.  The Long Term: A time period when all inputs can be changed.
3.  The law of diminishing returns:
    -   Total Product: Total output that a firm produces, using its fixed and variable factors.
    -   Average Product: Output that is produced, on average, by each unit of the variable factor.
    -   Marginal Product: Extra output produced by using an extra unit of the variable factor.
    -   Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns, Increasing Marginal Cost
