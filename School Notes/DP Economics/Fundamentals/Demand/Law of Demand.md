### Law of Demand baby

"As the price of a product falls, the quantity demanded of the product will usually increase, [[ceteris paribus]]"

1.  Income Effect: When a price falls, consumers' income seems higher since they spend less, so they buy more. Thus increasing the quantity demanded. Consumers' real income, purchase power, have increased.
2.  Substitution Effect: Consumers get utility from consuming goods, this relates to the law of diminishing utility. If the price of a product falls, the ratio of utility to price will increase, making it more attractive compared to other products that haven't changed their prices.
