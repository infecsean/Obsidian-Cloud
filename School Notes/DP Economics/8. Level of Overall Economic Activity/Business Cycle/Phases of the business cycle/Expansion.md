# Expansion
---
o.218 c.260

In the recovery phase we see economic expansion.
- Expansion happens when there is a ==positive growth== in ==real GDP==.
During expansion:
- ==Employment== of resources ==increase==, this is largely due to an increase in Aggregate Demand in the economy, as households and firms are encouraged to spend more.
- Price Levels rise more rapidly, due to increasing aggregate demand that lead to rise of average prices
- As economy [[Peak or Boom|booms]], Inflationary pressure builds up and rate of growth of GDP will ==fall== as the economy nears its ==potential output== 
- Economic policy makers will react by slowing down the growth of economy and this may cause a fall in total demand.
