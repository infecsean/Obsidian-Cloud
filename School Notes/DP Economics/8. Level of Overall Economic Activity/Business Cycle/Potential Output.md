==Potential output==(Potential GDP): Output represented by the [[Long Term Growth Trend]]

### Unemployment
- As [[Expansion]] happen, rGDP grows, unemployment falls. Firms hire more labor
- As [[Contraction]] happens, rGDP falls, unemployment grows. Firms lay off workers
- There is a level of rGDP at which economies experience =="full employment"==
	- Full employment level of output/rGDP
	- Full employment ==doesnt mean== all resource is employed to its greatest extent
	- There will still be some amount of unemployment, known as "==Natural Rate of Unemployment=="
		- People are moving between jobs
		- moving between locations
		- training to get different/better jobs
		- temporarily unemployed

### Unemployment & Potential Output
- The output produced when there is ==full employment==
	- Unemployment = natural rate of unemployment
	- When ==actual GDP== > ==potential GDP==, unemployment < natural unemployment
	- When ==actual GDP== < ==potential GDP==, unemployment > natural unemployment
