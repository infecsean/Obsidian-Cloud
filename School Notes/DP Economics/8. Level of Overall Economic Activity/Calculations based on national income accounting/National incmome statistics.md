# Why gather statistics

### Why are [[Measuring National Income|national account]] gathered
- ==Economic growth== is an objective of governments, an increase in a country's national income over time, since it is a goal, ==data is gathered== to determine if the objective is met
- Governments use the statistics to 
	- ==develop policies==
	- develop models of economy and make ==forecast== about the future
- Businesses use it to make ==forecasts== about future demand
- Analyze ==performance== of economy (==[[Nominal vs real|real]]== values)
- Evaluate the standard of living/quality of life in a country (==not true==, but often equated)
- ==Basis== for comparing different countries

### Limitations (accuracy, comparisons, measurements)
- As said above, stats can be used for a lot of stuff, so we should be aware of its limitations
- ==Inaccuracies==: Stats come from a wide range of sources, they tend to be more accurate after ==a lag time== when additional data are included and revised
- ==Unrecorded/underrecorded economic activity - informal markets==:
	- National income account can only record economic activity officially recorded
		- ex. if you paint your own wall it will not be recorded, if you pay a painting company to do it, it will be recorded in ==GDP==
	- Most common in ==developing countries==, where much of the output doesnt get recorded
		- Farmers
		- illegal black market
		- tax evaders
	- Countries with higher tax burden have higher hidden economic activity
- ==External Cost==: GDP doesnt account for ==resource depletion==
	- Deforestation increases GDP, but it is not taken into account
	- These external costs will certainly compromise the quality of life, even as GDP icreases
- ==Other concerns==: Other quality of life concerns
	- GDP may grow due to people working longer, but they might not enjoy higher standards of living
	- Doesnt account for volunteer work
	- These can lead to better society but may be discouraged in the pursuit of economic growth
- ==Composition of output==:
