### Calculating [[Nominal vs real|nominal]] [[GDP]] using [[Approaches to measuring national income|expenditure approach]]
- As we have seen, the expenditure approach is calculated by C + I + G + (X-M)
- If we are given the nominal values of each element, we can calculate the GDP

### Calculating [[GDP vs GNI|GNI]]
- add to GDP the income of domestic residents earned abroad, then subtract from GDP the income paid abroad to foreigners
- GNI = GDP + Income from abroad - Income sent abroad
- Can be simplified as "Net income from abroad"
- GNI = GDP + net income from abroad

### Calculating [[Nominal vs real|real]] [[GDP|GDP/GNI]] using price deflators
- See page 257 (Cambridge) for example
- ==Nominal ==GDP is the current output valued at current prices
- ==Real== GDP is the current output valued at constant (base year) prices
- When refering to real GDP, we must also refer to the ==specific base year== used for calculation
