### How GDP deflator is derived
- The method in [[Calculating GDP and GNI]] is very lengthy as there are a lot of products whose values have to be measured
- ==Solution==: Economists use price indices.
	- ==Price Index==: Measure of average prices in ==one period== relative to average prices in ==a base year==.
- GDP Deflators: A price deflector using price index to convert [[Nominal vs real|nominal]] GDP to real GDP.
- ==GDP *deflator* ==$$\frac {nominal\:GDP}{real\:GDP}\times100$$
