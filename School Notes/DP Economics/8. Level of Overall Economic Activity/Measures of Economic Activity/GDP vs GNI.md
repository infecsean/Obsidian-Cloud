# GDP vs GNI
---
c.253, o.213
### Why would we need GNI?
- Say that you are from taiwan, you live in taiwan, but you work remotely and your company is in Spain, your income comes from Spain. Should the income be counted in the calculation of Taiwan's GDP or Spain's GDP?
- It is included in Taiwan's GNI, and Spain's GDP

### Distinctions GDP & GNI
- [[GDP]] is the total of all economic activity within a country, ==regardless of asset ownership==
- ==GNI== (Gross national income) is the total income earned by a country's factors of production, regardless of ==where its assets are located==
- =="Domestic"== here means output produced by factors of production ==within the country==, regardless of owner
- =="National"== here means income of a ==country's residents==, regardless of where
- GNI = GDP + income from assets abroad - income paid to foreign assets
- GNI = GDP + net property from abroad
