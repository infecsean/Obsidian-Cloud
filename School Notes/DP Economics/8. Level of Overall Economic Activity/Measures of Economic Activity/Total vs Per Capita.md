# Total and Per Capita
---
```ad-noone
Per capita is from latin
it means, per person
```
### What is per capita
- A per capita takes the total output and divides it by the total population of a country.
- So ==GDP per capita== of a country is the total GDP of the country divided by the total population

### Distinction between total and per capita
- ==Different size/population across countries==: Both have the same GDP, but Country A has 1 million people, Country B have 2 million people. Doing the calculations, A has larger GDP per capita than B.
- ==Population Growth==: Changes in size of GDP/GNI over time depend on the relationship between the growth in GDP/GNI and growth in population. If ==GDP ↑ faster than population ↑, GDP per capita ↑==. If ==Population↑ faster than GDP, GDP per capita ↓==
