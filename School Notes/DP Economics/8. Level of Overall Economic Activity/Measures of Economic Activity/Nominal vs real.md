# Nominal vs Real values
---
c.254,o.213
### Differences between Nominal and real
- ==Nominal==: Measured in terms of current prices, not accounting for change in prices
- ==Real==: Measures that have eliminated the influence of changes in price.
- When a variable is being compared over time, use ==real values==

### Process of getting real values
- We take the nominal GDP (Current prices)
- Adjust for inflation through a =="GDP deflator"==
- We then get the real GDP
- Real GDP/GNI = Nominal GDP/GNI adjusted for inflation
