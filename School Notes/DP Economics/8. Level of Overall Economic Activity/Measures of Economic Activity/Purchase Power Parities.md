# Purchase Power Parities
---
In order to make accurate comparisons between different [[Nominal vs real|real values]], we need to make another distinction.
Why? Because ==price levels== in differnt countries may change. 5000 USD might be able to buy 1 ambulance ride in the US, but it could buy 100 in the UK (I think).

### The method
- To eliminate the influence of ==price differences on the value of output/income==, we need to develop a method
- This method that provides special exchange rates is called ==purchasing power parities==, literally meaning "buying power equivalence".
- Definition: The amount of a country's currency needed to buy the same quantity of local goods/services that can be bought with a fixed amount of money locally.
