### Why measure national income?
The output of an economy is called ==national output==, also known as ==aggregate output==, which means total output. The act of measuring this is called ==national income accounting==.
We measure these cus it allows us to:
- assess an economy's performance over time
- make comparisons with other economies (input/output performance)
- establish a basis for making policies

```ad-noone
We use "value" when refering to output instead of quantities in microecon.
Cus in micro, we need to add up quantities of output of goods/services.
In macro, we cant add up quantities of goods/services, so we simply use value.

Value is its ==quantity== multiplied by its ==price==.
