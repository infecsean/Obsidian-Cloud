# Approaches to measuring national income
---
### National income = National output = National expenditure

### Terms
- ==Final==: (ex. final goods/services) refers to goods/services ready for final use. Contrasted with Intermediate goods, those that are ==purchased as input for production== of final good. Ex. Food bought by restautants are intermediate goods, used to make a meal, and the meal is the final good
- ==Double counting==: Using the food and meal example. We only calculate the value of FINAL goods cus otherwise we would count the value of the food AND meal, which would be counted twice, double counting.

### 1. Output method
- This calculates the national output.
- By measring the ==actual value== of final goods and services produced.
- Calculated by adding the values firms created in an economy
- Usually separates production into sectors: Agriculture, manufacturing, service
- Refers to arrow ==(3)== in the diagram.
### 2. Income method
- Calculates national income.
- By measuring the ==value of all income== earned in the economy by the factors of production
- Refers to arrow ==(2)== in the diagram
### 3. Expenditure method
- Calculates national expenditure.
- By measuring the ==value of all spending on final goods/services== in an economy
- Calculated by adding all spending in different sectors
	- (==C==)Consumption: all purchases by households on final goods
		- Exceptions: housing is considered investment
	- (==I==) Investment: spending by firms on capital goods, new construction
	- (==G==) Government: government spending
	- (==X-M==) Net export: Foreigner spending. Export - Import
		- Since export are produced within the country
- Refers to arrow (==4==) in the diagram
