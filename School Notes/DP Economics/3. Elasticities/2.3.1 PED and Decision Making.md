# Decision Making
---
It is very important for firms and the government to consider PED when posing taxes or pricing, since different PED will lead to different response in consumers.

### Firms
When firms wanna increase [[0.1 Total Revenue|total revenue]]
IF DEMAND IS ELASTIC: lower price
IF Demand is inelastic: Raise price
IF demand is unit elastic: Cant do anything to the price

### Government
Government wanna increase tax revenue
They have to consider the consequences of imposing indirect taxes:

```ad-example
Say product A is elastic, the governmet now increased taxes on product A, raising the price, it would lower sales by a lot, leading to unemployment in the supplier side.
```
