For YED, whether YED is positive or negative decides if the good is a normal good or inferior good (This [[Non-Price Determinants of Demand|concept]] is also touched upon in the demand section)

The demand for a normal good rises as the income rises, and the demand for inferior goods fall as income rises.

### Normal Goods (YED > 0)
