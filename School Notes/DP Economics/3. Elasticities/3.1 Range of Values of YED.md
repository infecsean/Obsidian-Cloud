# Range of values of YED
---
For YED, whether YED is positive or negative decides if the good is a normal good or inferior good (This [[Non-Price Determinants of Demand|concept]] is also touched upon in the demand section)

The demand for a normal good rises as the income rises, and the demand for inferior goods fall as income rises.

### Normal Goods (YED > 0)
(btw %+ is percentage increased)

```ad-definition
title: TLDR
Graphically, different YED values would result in shifts horizontally

```

If %+ Quantity Demanded < %+ Income, then 0<YED<1, and it's Income-inelastic
But enough of the bullshit, "What does it stand for?". ==If a good is income inelastic, it is a necessity==. Don't believe me? Next time you get a raise try finding another brand of fucking milk, its a necessity, it doesnt care about your money, you need it no matter how fucking rich you are, steve jobs probably drank milk but that doesnt matter cus hes dead now.

If %+ Quantity Demanded > %+ Income, then YED > 1, and it's Income-elastic.
==If a good is income elastic, it is a superior good (Luxury)==. People tend to buy superior stuff when they are richer. who the fuck wouldve thought. Imagine this, you buy a ticket to fuckin Hualien, where your grandpa lives or something, but suddenly you win a lottery, so now you can go to hawaii instead of hualien, unless of course its a funeral or you just really want to see your grandparents.

### Inferior Goods (YED < 0)
Demand decreases as income increases. This is pretty self explanitory, since you would give up your shitty iphone 10 for the exact same iphone 13 but with a higher price tag if your boss gives you a raise.


### Engel Curve
Ah yes, the Engel curve.
Its named after 19th century German economist, Ernest Engel, nobody asked.

Important concept here from the second determinant of PED is that [[2.2 Determinants of PED|necessity is subjective]]
