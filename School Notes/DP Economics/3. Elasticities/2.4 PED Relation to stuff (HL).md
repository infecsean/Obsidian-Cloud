title:Terminology
Primary Commodities: These are basically raw materials. For example: Coal, agricultural products.

Manufactured Products: These are the products processed from raw materials.

Price Volatility: IRL, large fluctuations over short periods of time is called price volatility.
```

### Different PED between the two
Primary Commodities are raw materials, meaning that many companies are going to buy from them since there are rarely any substitudes, leading to a ==LOWER PED==(Very Inelastic)

Manufactured Products are products made by companies, and since there would be many companies making similar products, if the price increase, ppl will go buy other substitudes, leading to ==HIGHER PED==(Very Elastic)

Heres an exception:
Medications are manufactured goods, but they have lower ped, since tey are often considered to be necessities.

Supply drop leads to increase in TR, and supply increase lead to TR decrease, this is a problem, since unstable prices and quantity is very dangerous. This is hard to solve since farmers cant control the weather.
This is one of the reason behind government intervention.
