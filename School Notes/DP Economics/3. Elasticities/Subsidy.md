# Subsidy
---
### Government Assistance (Payment/Loan(fixed amount per unit)) to firm or industry or producers

### Reasons for providing subsidy
1. Increase Producer revenue
	- Producer recieve price = market price + subsidy
2. Make goods affordable to low income consumers
3. Encourage production (Supply ↑) and consumption of merit goods (Price ↓)

4. Encourage export of goods (P ↓) (Goods become conpetitive)


### Market Outcome
P↓: Pe -> P1
Q↑: Qe -> Q1

### Producer Receive Price ↑
Pp = P1 + Subsidy

### Government expenditure on subsidy
(Pp - P1) x Q1 = bcdefg = efgij (bcd = ij)

### Over-allocation Qe -> Q1
Qe: Market optimal production
