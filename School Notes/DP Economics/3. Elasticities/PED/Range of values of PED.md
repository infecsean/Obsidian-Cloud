# Range of values in [[PED|PED]]
---
In theory, PED can be infinitely big, different values carry different meaning, we gon talk about that here

```ad-info
title: TLDR
![[ROVPED.png]]
also disgustingly oversimplified
```

### Price Inelastic (Inelastic Demand)
- Demand is price inelastic when 0 < PED < 1
- Change in quantity is smaller than change in price
- In english, this means that when the price of a product falls, the sales will not fall as much in proportion, so the [[0.1 Total Revenue|total revenue]] gained by the firm will increase
- If a firm wanna raise the total revenue, and its products are relatively inelastic, it should raise the price (not professional advice)

### Price Elastic (Elastic Demand)
- Demand is price elastic when 1 < PED < ∞
- Change in quantity is bigger than change in price
- In english, this means that  In english, this means that when the price of a product falls, the sales will fall more in proportion, so the total revenue gained by the firm will decrease
-  If a firm wanna raise the total revenue, and its products are relatively elastic, it should **NOT** raise the price (again not professional advice)

### Unit Elastic
- Demand is price elastic when PED = 1
- Change in quantity is equal to the change in price
- If the price of a product drops by 5%, it will lead to a 5% rise in the quantity demanded. so PED is one and TR wont change
- graphically, it would look like this![[unitelasticPED.png]]

### Perfectly Inelastic
- PED = 0 , $PED = \frac 0{\%Δ\:Price\:of\:product}$
- A change in the price of a product will have no affect on demand
- an example would be a heroin addict, who will buy heroin no matter the cost, (answering for a friend)
- a graphic demonstration![[inelasticdemandcurve.png]] thanks oxford

### Perfectly Elastic
- PED = ∞, $PED = \frac {\%Δ\:Quantity\:Demanded\:of\:product}0$
- A change in price that originally had fucking infinite demand no matter what, but the slightest fucking change would result in the sales droppin to 0, what a buncha snowflakes
- basically "all or nothing at all"
