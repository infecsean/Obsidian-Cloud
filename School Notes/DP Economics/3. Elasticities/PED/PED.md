# PEDophile (Price Elasticity of Demand)
---

#### In simple terms:
$$PED = \frac {\%Δ\:Quantity\:Demanded\:of\:product}{\%Δ\:Price\:of\:product}$$

or
$$PED = \frac {\frac{ΔQ}{Q_i} * 100}{\frac{ΔP}{P_i} * 100}$$


#### In details: 
How much the demand is changed when there is a change in price.

Since it is stated in the [[Law of Demand]], that demand and price has a negative relationship (Price +, Demand -, and vice versa, [[Ceteris Paribus]]), we want to know by **how much** does it change.

```ad-note
title: the \-
collapse: open
yes, the negative sign
Since price and demand has an inverse relationship, PED is always negative
So we ignore the negative sign, we take the absolute value

"but why?"
well, if we had been using the negative sign, we would say that -2 is larger than -3 (its not btw, not in econ you fucker)
```
```ad-note
title: the %
collapse: open
yes, the percentage
1. We want to measure the responsiveness independent of the units. like for real u gonna tell me that we comparin 3 apples to 3 Apples? or compare 3 pounds of meat to 3 kilos of meat? fuck no
2. We also wanna consider the change in percentages, since its meaningless to consider a 50$ off product with a 10 sales increase

Also, different ped have different meaning :), its very complex
but heres a disgustingly simplified table of what ranges of ped mean
