### What changes PED?
1. Number and closeness of subsidies
	- But what is number and closeness you ask?
	- If a product has a lot of subsidies, and if the price of that product rises, customers will switch to the subsidies, assuming their price stays constant
	- So as the number of subsidies increase, the more elastic a product will be
	- "oh shit the price rose, guess ill switch to the other brand of toothpaste"
2. Necessities VS Luxury
	- Luxury here can be defined as the range that the term covers, for example, the term food, refers to a necessity, but narrow it down to meat, meat is not a necessity, since there are many alternatives.
	- Remember,
	- ### Necessity is subjective,
	- since people often have different tastes
