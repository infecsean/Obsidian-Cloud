# Determinants of PED

### What changes PED?
1. Number and closeness of subsidies
	- But what is number and closeness you ask?
	- If a product has a lot of subsidies, and if the price of that product rises, customers will switch to the subsidies, assuming their price stays constant
	- So as the number of subsidies increase, the more elastic a product will be
	- "oh shit the price rose, guess ill switch to the other brand of toothpaste"
2. Necessities VS Luxury
	- Luxury here can be defined as the range that the term covers, for example, the term food, refers to a necessity, but narrow it down to meat, meat is not a necessity, since there are many alternatives.
	- Remember,
	- ### Necessity is subjective,
	- since people often have different tastes
	- Also, addictives: The more addictive a product is, the more inelastic its demand is.

3. Time Period Considered
	- The time period here stands for the time that the consumer has to consider buying the product
	- The longer the time the consumers have to consider, the more elastic the product is, since in the short term, it is often inelastic, while in the long term, it is often more elastic. Concept from [[Law of supply]].

4. Proportion of Income spent on good
	- An exception being the status quo bias
	- If the good takes up only a small part of a person's budget, they will less likely change their mind if the price changes, making it more inelastic. Whereas if say, a car's price increases with the same proportion, you are less likely to buy it
