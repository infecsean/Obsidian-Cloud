# Applications of PES
---
In [[Determinants of PED]], it is said that primary commodities have inelastic PED, since it is a necessity and not many subsidies.

### Primary Commodities PES lower than Manufactured
Primary Commodities usually have [[Range of Values of PES|lower PES]] (low elasticity) than manufactured products.
This is due to the [[Length of Time PES]] factor, being able to relocate resources slower than manufacture companies. Since they have to consider the weather and season stuff, and manufacturers dont.

The supply of manufactured goods tend to be ==more elastic==, it is also more likely that they have [[Spare Capacity of firms|unused capacity]] and [[Ability to store stocks]], so it will be relatively ==elastic==.
