![[Range of Values PES.png]]
### Price Elastic (∞ > PES > 1)
%ΔQuantity Supplied > %Δ Price
Change in price => Proportionally ==more== change in Qs

### Price Inelastic (PES < 1)
%Δ Quantity Supplied < %Δ Price
Change in price => Proportionally ==less== change in Qs

### Unit Elastic (PES = 1)
%Δ Quantity Supplied = %Δ Price
Change in price => Proportional change in Qs

### Perfectly Inelastic (PES = 0)
In the [[Law of supply|short run]], sometimes called the immediate time period, producers cant possibly increase their supply straight away, until new [[Non-Price Determinants of Supply|factors of production]] is employed.

### Perfectly Elastic (PES = ∞)
Sometimes primary commodities such as wheat, in countries, are infinitely supplied, as long as consumers are ready to pay the "world market" price. The market will have a perfectly elastic price.
