The [[Law of supply]]: Positive relationship between Price and quantity supplied.

If there is ==large responsiveness== of quantity supplied, supply is ==elastic==. If there is ==relatively small response== in quantity supplied, supply is ==inelastic==.


### How to calculate Price Elasticity Of Supply
$$PES = \frac {\%Δ\:Quantity\:of\:goods\:supplied}{\%Δ\:Price\:of\:product}$$

or
$$PES = \frac {\frac{ΔQ}{Q_i} * 100}{\frac{ΔP}{P_i} * 100}$$
