# Length of Time
---
Amount of time firms have to change their quantity of supply in response to change in price.

In the short term, producers cant really change [[Range of Values of PES|it]], so supply is highly inelastic, even perfectly inelastic. 

The ==longer== the time, the ==more elastic== it will be.

```ad-example
Fishermen that just got back, met with grow in demand, cant immediately change the amount of fish they supply.
