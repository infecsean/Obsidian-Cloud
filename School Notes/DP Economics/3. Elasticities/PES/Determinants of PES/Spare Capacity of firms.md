# Spare Capacity of Firms
---
Sometimes producers might have capacity to produce, but not using them. In the case that ==they do==, they can respond with ==increased== output to a price change. In the case that ==they dont==, it would be more ==difficult== to respond to a price rise.

The greater the spare capacity, the higher the PES (More elastic).
