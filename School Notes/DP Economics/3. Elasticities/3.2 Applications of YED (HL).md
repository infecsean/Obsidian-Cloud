### Firm Decisions
Producers can know what to produce for the market.
A product with High YED will see large increase in demand as income increases in a country, leading to rapid growth in the market. 
```ad-example
Producers will keep an eye on the YED of their products, if the income of a country is growing, the demand for smartphones will rise proportionally, and so the producers would expand to that country.
```

Producers often make several versions of a product to appeal to different income levels, so that they can change the production amount rather than the prices later on.
```ad-example
If say, the income level of a country drops, the manufacturing company might produce less of the superior goods and more of the inferior goods.

## Sectorial Structure
Every economy can be split into three sectors: ==Primary Sector, Manufacturing Sector (Secondary Sector), and Service Sector (Tertiary Sector).==

Primary Sector: Products are known as primary products. This often includes agricultural, fishing, forestry, etc...

Manufacturing Sector: They take the raw materials/primary products and manufacture ==producer goods== such as machinery or ==consumer goods== like electronics or clothes.

Service Sector: Industries that produce services or intangible (non physical) products, such as financial service or education.
