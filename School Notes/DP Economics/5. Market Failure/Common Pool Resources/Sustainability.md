By definition, sustainability means that the consumption of a certain resource does not reduce the quality for future generations. Not depleting or degrading resources. 

Sustainable resource means to use resources at a rate that ==allows the resource to reproduce== and not become depleted.

For example, my iPhone 8's battery. Its been a long while since it says "your battery is fucking degraded as fuck bro". I am not using my iPhone sustainably, and people who use this iphone after me would be getting a severly degraded battery that depletes in 10 fucking minutes.

### Maximum Sustainable yield

This illustrates the max sustainable yield.

When there are 3 boats, each boat brings back about 4 tonnes of fish. (==Constant Yield==)
With each additional boat, each boat bring back less fish. (==Decreasing Yield==)
When reached a certain point, fish supply becomes ==overused==, and fish are not able to reproduce themselves anymore, so they all bring back less fish (==Absolutely decreasing==)
