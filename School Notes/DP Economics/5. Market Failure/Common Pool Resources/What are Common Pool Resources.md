This is related to [[Negative Externalities]].

Resources that are ==not owned== by anyone, ==dont have a price==, and available to anyone.

CPRs are different from any other resources because they are ==rivalrous== and ==non-excludable==. This relates to the concept of [[Private Goods]].

CPRs are rivalrous, meaning the consumption of it will reduce availability.
They are also non-excludable, meaning they have no price, that anyone can use them.

In 1968, biologist Garrett Hardin wrote "Tragedy of the Commons", examining consequences of the non-excludability of CPRs.

The example shows that the fertile pasture is rivalrous, since when eaten, it is unavailable to other animals. It is also non-excludable since one herder cant prevent others from entering. It shows the ==cumilative effect off== people under ==self governance== acting in their own ==self interest== resulting in a fall of social welfare.
