Overview:
- Market Failure
- Merit goods, demerit goods, public goods
- Positive and negative externalities of production and consumption (prob only neg)
- Common pool resources
- gov policies in response to externalities and common pool resources
- International cooperation addressing sustainability

### Why market failure exist?
- Cus the real world market is pretty shit (not allocative efficient)
- We look at actions that have negatve effects on others and the environment
- We also look at what gov does to help solve some of these

When quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied, we have reached allocative efficiency, MB = MC, max social surplus.

But we often fail in the real world. And we expect the government to interviene to attempt to fix the market. Market Failure doesnt necessarily suggest that society isnt advancing, but rather have to be supported by appropriate government policies.
