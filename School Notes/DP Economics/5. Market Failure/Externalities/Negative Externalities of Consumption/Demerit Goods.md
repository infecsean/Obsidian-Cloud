Demerit goods are goods that are harmful to the consumers but they either arent aware or they ignore it, they harm the consumers, but are overprovided. Demerit goods also produce [[Negative Externalities of Consumption|negative externalities]] when consumed.

Also, not all goods that create negative externalities are demerit goods, such as petrol, it harms the environment, but the driver doesnt necessarily inhale all the exhaust smoke.

Government aim to reduce consumption of demerit goods, which will ==benefit the consumers==, but more importantly, ==reduce welfare loss== and benefit society as a whole.
