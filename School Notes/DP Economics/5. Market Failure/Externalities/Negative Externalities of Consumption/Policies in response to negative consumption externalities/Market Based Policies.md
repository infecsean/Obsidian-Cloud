Indirect Pigouvian Taxes, in this case, indirect taxes imposed on goods that create external cost when consumed (petrol & stuff). 
![[Effects of Pythagorean Tax neg con.png|400]]
When tax is imposed, supply decreases, and supply curve ==MPC => MPC + tax==. If tax = external cost, quantity produced drops to Qopt, and we've reached social optimum. 

### Advantages
Economists prefer indirect taxes, as they ==internalise externalities==, (in the case of negative consumption externalities). Tax creates higher price which creates ==incentive== for consumers to consume less. 

### Disadvantages
Measuring external cost. For example, second handed smoking, we cant measure how or who are affected, so we cant determine the right tax.

Some goods that produce negative consumption externalities have ==[[PED|inelastic demand]]==, meaning that ==%↓ Demand < %↑ Price==, meaning that while good for government revenue, not good for decreasing demand. It would be politically unacceptable to put an effective tax. 

If tax is too high, they can just travel elsewhere to buy them. This way, not only ==does government not get tax revenue, the consumption isnt reduced==. 

They are ==*regressive*==, meaning they impact poor people more than rich people. Rich people pay the same amount of tax, but poor people pay larger proportion of their income. ==inequitable==.
