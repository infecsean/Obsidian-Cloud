# Nudges
---
Consumers wont always have perfect information and wont always make rational decisions. 

One example is, you guessed it, smoking!!! (this economics book must really fucking hate smokers huh), "Dyin Bryan".


### Ad-Disadvantages
There isnt enough research to design effective nudges. Nudge effectiveness may also differ in different culture groups.
