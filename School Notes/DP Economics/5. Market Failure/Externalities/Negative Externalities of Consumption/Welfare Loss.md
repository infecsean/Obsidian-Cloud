# Welfare Loss of negative consumption externalities

![[Negative Consumption Externality Welfare Loss.png|300]]
Picture a shows the ==welfare loss== to ==negative consumption externalities==. It represents the loss of social benefits due to overallocation of resources in the production of the good. For all units produced over $Q_{opt}$ , MSC > MSB, meaning too much is produced.

==Welfare loss== is equal to the difference between ==MSC and MSB==. (The grey area)

Note on graph c: Market equilibrium IS NOT social optimum. The consumer surplus when ==market equilibrium== is ==a + b==, and producer surplus is ==c + d + f==. The external cost is ==a + d + e==. So total social benefits is ==b + c + f - e==. At ==social optimum==, producer surplus is ==f==, consumer surplus is ==b + c==. So total social benefit is ==b +  c + f==.
