Many products affect third parties when consumed, like ciggies with the whole "second-handed smoking", additionally, this increases smoking related health issues, resulting in higher than necessary burden for society.

When there is a ==consumption externality==, ==MPB== does ==NOT== reflect social benefit.


```ad-example
Take the smoker example, they smoke to enjoy private benefits of smoking, but reduce benefits others recieve (create losses), thru passive smoking and stuff.
They overconsume ciggies from Q* to Q1, and since MSC is greater than MSB now, there is a ==[[Welfare Loss]]==.
