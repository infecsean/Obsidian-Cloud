So remember chapter 2? the allocative efficiency part? it says that

Externalities occur when the ==production / consumption== of a good/service affects a third party. 
If the effect is harmful, we call it ==negative externalities==, meaning there is an external cost in addition to private cost of producer/consumer to reflect full social cost.
If the effect is ==beneficial==, we call it ==positive externalities==, meaning there is an external benefit that adds to the private benefits of producers/consumers.
