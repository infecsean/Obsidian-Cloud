# Marginal Private Benefit / Cost & Marginal Social Benefit / Cost
---
As we know, the demand curve represents marginal benefits, and marginal benefit is benefit recieved by consumers. Since the benefits go to private individuals, who buy and consume, the demand curve is the ==marginal private benefit==. Marginal cost is the cost to producers producing goods, so the supply curve represents ==marginal private costs==.

==MSC = MPC ± external cost/benefit of production.
MSB = MPB ± external cost/benefit of consumption==

MSB curve represents the full benefit of the society for consuming a good.
MSC curve represents the full benefit of the society for producing a good.

If the actions of Producers/Consumers dont affect third parties (no externalities), we've reached an equilibrium that reflect the ==*social optimum*==, where we've reached ==allocative efficiency==. We use $Q_{opt}$ is the ==socially optimum output==.

If theres an externality, the MSC will differ from MPC, and the MSB will differ from MPB. When this happens, the ==intersection of MPC and MPB== is ==no longer social optimum==, allocative inefficiency is introduced by social cost/benefit differing from private ones.
