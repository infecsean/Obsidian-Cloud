When a consumer buys and consumes a good, they derive some benefits. When a producer produce and sell goods, it incurs cost. Some of the benefit or cost spill over to others, who have no business with them.
Externalities occur when the ==production / consumption== of a good/service affects a third party. 
If the effect is harmful, we call it ==negative externalities==, meaning there is an external cost in addition to private cost of producer/consumer to reflect full social cost.
If the effect is ==beneficial==, we call it ==positive externalities==, meaning there is an external benefit that adds to the private benefits of producers/consumers.
