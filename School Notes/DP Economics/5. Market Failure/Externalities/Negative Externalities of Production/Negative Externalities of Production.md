When the ==production== of a good or service causes an external cost that damages third parties. (Relate mainly but not exclusively to sustainability)(tho producers would wanna max out profit in the absence of [[Government Intervention]], and not give fuck about sustainability).

### Notice
notice how: 
==Free market outcome== is determined by the intersection of ==MPB== and ==MPC== => Qm, Pm
==Social Optimum outcome== is determined by intersection of ==MSB== and ==MSC== => Qopt, Popt

```ad-example
Paint factory: Produce paint. Other than private costs for producing, also external costs. So the marginal social cost > marginal private cost.
It produces at Q1, not Q*, the social optimum, and so it is a market failure.
