Education and awareness creation often make consumers turn away from the products, with negative effects to firms. Firms are therefore forced to take into consideration their opinions to ==reduce externalities==. 

```ad-example
Good example i can think of: Peta
The Gucci bags and fuckin LV bags that are made of living skinned animals. People will cancel you for buying that.
```
### Advantages
- Firms care a lot about their opinions, so this will be very effective

### Disadvantages
- Maybe only a small localized area will have a good impact
- Hard to make worldwide impact
