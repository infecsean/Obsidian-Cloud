### Indirect Taxes (Pigouvian Tax)
A tax results in ==upward shift== of supply curve, ==MPC => MSC (MPC+ tax)==
The optimal tax is exactly the amount of ==externality==, cus that makes the ==MPC shift up== so it ==overlaps with MSC==, leading to ==allocative efficiency==.

### Carbon Taxes
Tax per unit of carbon emmisions.
Imposed when ==fossil fuel== is burned. This is a way to make people pay for the external cost, "polluter pays" is a way to ==internalise externalities==.
Though not able to completely remove welfare loss, still a good way to move market closer to social effeciency. Also create incentive for firms to switch to more non-polluting energy sources.

Benefits:
- Producers will find another way to produce less carbon so they can make more profit (Incentive)
- Consumers reduce consumption of electricity
- Switch energy sources, such as renewable ones
- generate tax revenue

### Tradable Permits
Permits made by the government can be traded on the market.
They allow a firm to produce a certain amount, so it gives producers incentive to produce less so they can ==sell permit== that are extra, on the market.

==[[PES|perfectly inelastic]]== supply, as it is at a fixed amount set by the government.

For effectiveness, the amount the permit allows should be ==lower than== carbon emmision levels ==without== the permits.
Shifts the ==MSC== curve to ==MPC==, shown in graph b.
