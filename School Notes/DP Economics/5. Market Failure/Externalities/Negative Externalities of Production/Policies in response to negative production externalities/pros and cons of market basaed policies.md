### Advantages
- Taxes and tradable permits ==internalise externality==.
- Tax on carbon is more effective than output tax, since the latter only give incentive to produce less, while carbon tax give incentive to change to another source.

### Disadvantages
Tax:
- What production methods produce pollutants?
- What pollutants are harmful?
- What is the value of the harm?
- What is the appropriate amount of tax?
- How will consumers be effected?
- Carbon taxes are too low to make significant impact

Tradable Permits:
- Dont have enough information to know what level to set
- If too high, it will be ineffective
- If too low, it will be costly for firms
- Method of distribution must be developed, to not allow favoritism
- Might be able to shift ==MPC== towards ==MSC==, but unlikely
