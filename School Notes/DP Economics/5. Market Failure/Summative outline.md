2.  Evaluate two policies that governments might implement to correct externalities associated with the environment.

1). ![[Negative Consumption Externality Welfare Loss.png|300]]
Define market failure -> define demerit good -> explain why demerit good cause negative externalities -> explain how negative externalities lead to market failure

Analysis of graph: 
Explain why D = MSB != MPB (more is being produced than has to)

Explain how purchase of alcohol lead to market failure by providing examples (drunk drivers, less productive work and less sober society ig)

2). 
Indirect tax:
Pros - as price rise it serves as an incentive to stop buying and stop producing
Cons - alcohol is addictive (inelastic), awareness not raised since people wont know they paying taxes, unfair cus rich people still able to buy

~~Restrict use:
Pros - Effective as it gives incentive to dont do illegal shit, 
~~
Education & awareness raising:
Pros - Some will become aware and withdraw, effective if carried out seriously (however),
