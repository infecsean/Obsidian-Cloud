# Non-Price Determinants of Supply
---
-   1.  The cost of factors of production
    
    -   If the cost of factors of production increases, such as the wage of workers, the cost for firms to produce a product will increase.
-   2.  The price of related goods - Competitive and joint supply
    
    -   Competitive Supply: Producers can choose what to produce since the factors of production they control can produce many products. If the price of a type of pen rises due to high demand, the producer may be inclined to reduce the quantity produced of other unpopular pens.
    -   Joint Supply: Sometimes, when a good is produced, another good will be produced in the process, sometimes called by-products. If the demand for petrol increases, the supply of petrol will increase, but also its by-product, diesel. Quantity Demand Petrol Increase, Quantity Supply Diesel Increase.
-   3.  Government Intervention - indirect taxes and subsidies
    
    -   Indirect Taxes(Expenditure Taxes): Taxes that are added to the price of a product. Producers have to pay taxes, increasing the cost to produce for the firms. Shift supply curve upwards.
    -   Subsidies: Payments made by governments to firms, reduce the cost of production.
-   4.  Expectations about future prices
-   5.  Changes in tech
-   6.  Weather or natural disasters
