# What are shaders?
---
Programs that are running on the graphics processing unit (GPU)

After the culling phase,

### Vertex Shader

Takes individual vertex coordinates and turn them from object space into clip space (idk wtf clip space is)
Converts the vectorial representation into pixels, NOT COLORS THATS FOR TH-

### PIXEL SHADER (fragment shader)


Compute shaders allow programmers to take advantage of the parallel rendering capability.
