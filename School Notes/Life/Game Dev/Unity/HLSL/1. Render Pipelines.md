# Rendering
---
See the [unity manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/Manual/BestPracticeLightingPipelines.html) on this topic.

Three stages:

### Culling
The render pipeline lists out objects that need to be rendered, preferably ones visible to the camera, and unoccluded by others, occlusion culling basically means that objects that aren't in the camera's FOV, are not rendered.

### Rendering
Turned into pixel-based buffers. Lines of the objects are being drawn, along with some properties.

### Post-processing
Post processing operations can be carried out on buffers, for applying things like bloom and depth of field.
