### Storyline
Light machine rings (light conditions critical)

You wake up from bed

"Good morning Heather"

Heather: 

"I know girl"

"It's been lonely for me too"

"I have to light up now"

"It's dark, I know, that's why I have to light up"

"Dont worry, I'll be back"

You walk out of the house, open the fence door

*breath* "just follow the yellow stick rope"

"It's been a while since I had to light the torches"

"I'm just not born to be a runner"

[into ring 1, a plain grass flat land]
[pass by a picnic table]

"Hey I remember this spot, mom used to make sandwiches every sunday"

"I remember when dad used to bring me to ring 15"

"We would fish and swing around the trees together"

[arriving at ring 2, starting to slope downwards]
[there is a marking of number counting on it]
"hmm...i wonder what they were counting"

"it couldn't be the monsters, it's only ring 2"

"nevermind"

"just keep going"

[into ring 2]

"mind your step"

"this is going to be a pain coming back up"

"this part is mainly just forest"

"a transitional space if you will"

"tho, the kids used to play on the trees"

"i tried to climb up to the tree house last year, but it collapsed"

[into ring 3, a flat pathway with farm pits]

"I remember when ring 3 was entirely farmland"

"I wish uncle johnny had survived the attack"

"i wouldn't have to grow my own food by myself"

"we used to run through his field when we were young"

"he would chase us with a fork"

[into ring 4, lumber processing]

"ah...good times"

"if only Markus had got to station 30 fast enough"

"i suppose it's no use saying that since he's dead"

"and i suppose...everyone else"

[into ring 5]

[a cry in the darkness]

"oh shit"

"i have to seal off ring 5"
