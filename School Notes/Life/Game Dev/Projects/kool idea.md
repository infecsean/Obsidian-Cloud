1. Fly
### Brainsterm
- Im so sorry future me that i was inspired by fruit flies during the infestation
- You play as a fly
- Where other flies believe in a higher power, and want to seek approval from him
- (criticizing religion and indoctrination i guess)
- Your fly friends 
- also time passes 4 times slower for flies ([sauce](https://bigthink.com/life/the-reason-why-each-species-experiences-time-differently/))

### Storylin
- There will probably be 2 storylines
	- Fly kingdom
		- where you get to know all your fly buddies
		- and know more about the culture of flies
			- maybe even hinting at how they worship and praise others (how they interact with who they respect), revealing how they will consume the higher being later on
		- understand the objective
	- higher being guy
		- just a regular dude with a bug infestation problem (YOU)
		- you will learn about the dude (probably)
		- you will see the problems he goes through
	- also when flies and dude meet
		- you see how flies want to seek validation from dude and find ways to reach him, thinking that for some reason, he thinks they are not good enough for something (in reality he wants them DEAD)
		- how, at the end, at some point in dude's storyline, he kills himself by hanging
		- and how your fly buddies see that as "validation" because for once, he doesnt kill you and banish you with the mighty swatter
		- thinking that one of you passed the test, so all of you get to get "validated" and worship his "essense"
		- and so all the flies goes to feast on his body, as a sign of "==WORSHIP??==".

KEEP IN MIND, I CURRENTLY HAVE A BUG INFESTATION PROBLEM AND EoY, MY BRAIN IS COMPLETELY FUCKED AND IDC IF THIS IS FUBAR. 6/7 Sean, in physics
