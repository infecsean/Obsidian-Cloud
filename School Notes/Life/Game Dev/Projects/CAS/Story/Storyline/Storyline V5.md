# Storyline V5
---
## Themes
- Facade
	- The conflict between what is real and what is fake(a facade).
		- Mainly presented through Noah's colorful world and students' collective useless knowledge
			- need to make it so that it doesnt come off as "oh i know so much more than you, look at me, a struggling student" saviour complex type shit.
				- just make it so that it doesnt come off as me suggesting a way to fix the world, but a foreseeable philosophical personal problem that the audience is just a part of, without requiring their input
				- In other words, Empathy!
					- empathy for noah, for students, 
- Knowledge
	- This question of "what knowledge is worth"
		- In the form of class sequences (tho i have to admit, is quite weak) where teachers' methods of teaching are questioned by the player.
			- again, has to be not condescending. Either through showing an argument for both sides (cruel, but super effective)
		- In the form of the lie
			- Seeking knowledge without questioning knowledge. (condescend warn)
- Emotions
	- Dreams
		- Play on words - dream as in zzz... and dream as in aspirations
			- What are they worth?
			- Could make a scene out of this. "I had a cool dream where everythi-" "shut up, no one cares about your dreams"
		- Nightmares
			- Are they dreams?
	- Emotions are weaknesses that humans possess that disrupts the acquisition of knowledge

### Intro
> Ext. Station. Dream. Day

[Priority]
- Teach basic mechanics
	- Move around
	- Look around
	- Main method of interaction - talk, press button, menu, 
- Showcase central themes or something
	- Very imaginative mind/dream
		- Story about losing your grip/naivete(typo?)
		- logically start with your imaginative mind to contrast the destruction that comes
[Optional/can be in next section]
- Start the character arc
	- Event that disrupts the status quo
		- Usual routine with dreaming
		- Grandpa dying -> change the way of acquiring knowledge. BUT ALSO persists throughout the story as (maybe) a core motivation to drive the plot.
			- Need to reveal this without using blatant exposition (or do, idc)
	- Hint at the Lie
		- Knowledge is the most important thing in life, and seek it at all costs.
- Maybe introduce the dream-only mechanics to contrast with irl mechanics
