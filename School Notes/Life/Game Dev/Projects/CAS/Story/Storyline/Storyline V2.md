# Storyline V2
---
### Things to keep in mind
Social anxiety is supposed to be continuous, no jumpscare, just pure paranoia.
The narrater is the voice in your head, your subconscious.
- Tho the purpose is to tell an experience, there still has to be some sort of failing in each chapter/level
- Ask yourself "How is this a good segway into the next chapter?"
- =="if the player knows what to expect, they will get bored"==
- ==SHOW DONT TELL==
- Dont have many things [[Menu UI Design|fight for your attention]] (color theory)
- Regarding the "loneliness rule": The loneliest people can still be surrounded by many loved ones. It's not about how many people you have in your life. It's about how those people make you feel, or how you perceive your relationship with them. Like; do they love you unconditionally? Accept you for who you are? Understand you? Do they express how they feel or hide their feelings, and if so do you undestand or accept that? Do you hide a part of yourself because you think people will reject you for it?

### SCHOOLS: if students are causing problems, make it more difficult for them! (incentive)(instead of solving the root problem)(ex. school shooting, suicide, depression) [Sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usSfgHGEGxQ&list=LL&index=1&ab_channel=JacobGeller)
so that they wont be responsible for the problem
- Can probably use DHMIS as good inspiration

### Themes
- Afraid of being creative
- We dont need to learn what they tell us to learn
- We dont need to be punished by manipulators for disobeying them
- Authority figure disguised as a professor
- Interpretations are rejected and shamed
- Creativity is shoved in their faces
- Success by being manipulated and submissive learning
- Breaking in the class being punished
- Mind land is symbolic of creativity
- Authority figures will reject questions
- ==SOCIAL COMMENTARY LOOK IT UP==


### Ideas for progression
~~The windows will be fully lit at the start school, but slowly dim as you progress
Your mind is utilitarian, meaning that they will always tell you what you want to do, that is within your comfort zone~~
~~- I guess you suffer from episodes where you travel to places in your mind~~
~~- When in stress, press "e", does a coin flip. from rosencrants and guildenstern are dead: Tension can be created with the repeating chance of flipping a head!~~
~~- Maybe it is revealed at the end that you are already dead and reliving the school life~~
~~- ==You are given a mask, wear it when you feel unsafe and insecure== make the mask a bit more interesting than just a buff that allows immunity~~
- ~~The roof is off limits, which restricts escape. Once the roof is free, you watch from afar directly involve, students go to the roof, you watch them jump into the river, thinking they will all escape knowing that they will all die, but it is the lesser evil.~~
- - ~~mirrors: in the beginning you see your reflections call you names, in the end you shatter all the mirrors, no insecurities ;)~~

Game Features:
- Everybody is a social reject, every table in the library is occupied, with ONE person.
- only scene one is in the cherry blossom field to symbolize peace and blissful ignorance
- you have to be PERFECT, cant get into a good school otherwise (volcano thin rope walk)
- Expectations and responsibilities are presented: take something similar to brim's boulder in die for you, maybe something grand. "mount neverrest"
- Omori's "stab omori" [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUDGlEWa4sE&ab_channel=DarylTalksGames) give the player a thing they cant turn back from, like the needle to the eye from dead space or heavy rain where you have to mutilate yourself to save your son. "force you to do uncomfortable things to progress" milgram experiment
- 2 inventories, mental and real world
- You wear different masks to negate different people, objects, and restrict access
	- Your character 
- Stress gauge: Social interactions add little stress, but work adds lots of stress
- "could" and "should" dialogues: Juxtapose that you dont give yourself any other options
- BACKROOMS EASTER EGG IN MIND THAT LINKS TO REALITY
- Poster that says "STUDENT HAPPINESS 100%"
- Enemies have the kind of stealth radius based on the mask system
	- If you enter their sight with weaker mask, you add tons of stress
	- When stress overload, you cant change mask for further encounters
	- More emotions [stuff](https://www.conovercompany.com/the-importance-of-emotional-awareness-in-communication/)
- Maybe ==main villain== is school system, well, the big villain at least
	- ==Supporting enemies== are students - while also casually suicidal, also a social being, induces social anxiety
- MAKE A SPOTIFY PLAYLIST FOR EACH CHARACTER LMAO
- TOWN NAME?: Lockes town, Bridgeham Town (after carl brigham), 

Mind:
- You are only given a small amount of time to be mentally there, cus school takes up a that much time. So when the player are sent to the dimension, intentionally design the time limit so that they cant reach a deep enough part (underlying darkness, strange fruit) maybe do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqlHpPzS22U&t=74s&ab_channel=Brackeys)
- THE TREE OF LIFE ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN GROWS FRUIT
- You can only see the tree of life from afar, everytime you see a fruit, there is a person getting it off, but moments later they put a kind of defense around it to keep people out.
- Tree of knowledge: From a distance the guy that comes to the tree looks like a girl collecting the fruit, upon close inspection, it is the reaper.
- You are in denial in mind when things get black, you cant accept the fact that school is taking a toll on your mental health
	- citizens in your mind warns you that things change
- 

School:
- "i dont understand self harm, they just want attention i guess" "Yeah, otherwise they'd just kill themselves right?""==Snowflake=="(==Name-calling==)
- "There's nothing you can say that someone else hasnt said before"
- Schools solves the symptoms instead of the root problems.
	- that said, maybe include this into game
	- ==Features==: mattress on 1st floor to prevent suicide, long corridors to prevent shootings, 
	- dim lights that discourage studying, revolting doors that let students in but not out
~~- Violectors - Violet: color of corruption. Violence, Lectors~~
- water under the bridge: the water under the bridge is full of dead bodies
Events:
- ==every one of these events should have a foreshadowing told by the friend, to show you the truth first==. 
- Start with weekly ceremony: Introduce the core values of the school, (also serve as a brainwashing mechanic, believing over time). this is a good time to introduce the school's ==bad shit==, such as reminding the children that success does not come without hard work (if they slack, they fail). it is a known fact that successful people go to school
- Drug use speech: Show the irony in treating the symptom and not the root, ==overgeneralization== of kids that use drugs to be BAD KIDS and ==terrorists== (==name-calling==)and they will spread the drug use so mark them as dangerous (==fear==-based propaganda). "Those who catch and report them will be deemed a ==hero==!"
- School shooting speech (==exaggerate the propagandistic aspect==): Last year, 1 person made a decision, a decision at the cost of 12 lives. (that might be the introduction i guess). Point is, they will not let ==terrorists== take away our ==learning==! THEY MAY TAKE OUR LIVES BUT THEY MAY NEVER TAKE AWAY OUR ==EDUCATION==. (insert anti-school shooting campaign to fight against terrorists).
- After your friend do something bad, and only you are in the know, his public apology: Using fear and shame to suppress those who rebel. Award people who follow social conventions (winning awards)
- Charity event (==which is mandatory==, ==irony==): Guilt students into being grateful for what they have, make students give money, otherwise shame them. "With your contribution, you can make the world a better place!" "Everybody is contributing, why aren't you?" "Surely you have SOME money, right?" "==bad person=="(==name calling==) "if you dont contribute, youre as bad as they are!"
- PTSD experiments: traumatic events to engrade memory into students
- we prepare you for the real world, by creating a mini-society to train you
- stickers or signs sticked on people
- based on diseases and name-calling for disobedient children
	- you have to get your grades up so you won't get depression
	- depression is directly related to anger issues
	- the best way is to always stay happy and dont show sadness and anger
	- and the school wants the best and provides the best
		- and therefore dont allow students to be sad or angry
- lynks disease
- Different emotions have different effects on visual elements, outlined with neon shader with emotional colors
- 6x (success pun) (i have gone absolutely mental)
- lie detector/emotion detector event
	- "inquiry" room

- 3 Levels
	- Apparent Truth (Similar to statistics, choosing ==marketable information== that is crucial to consumers, then ensuring it at all ==costs==, often bad ones)
		- Student Happiness
			- Information: Students are happy | Cost: Drugs, Daily Score Policy (evaluates based on daily behaviour and results effect grades (sold in the form of statistics to keep students "happy": "Statistics show that sad students score BAD!", realistically controlled by school))
		- College Success
			- Information: Ensure safe passage for future through tech-assisted learning | Cost: Heavy workload and just everything about the school
	- Hypocrisy (Instead of solving problems, compensate the effects it has, motivated by desire to maintain a good status quo)
		- increased use of technology raise job barriers
			- Problem: High Job Barrier | Compensation: Speed Up student learning process | Status Quo: Robot Teachers are cheaper and tech makes a lot more money
		- overwhelm students with homework and claim "student freedom"
			- Problem: Conflicting goals of Efficient learning, time management, and student rights
			- Compensation: Claim the workload as "Time management training"
			- Status Quo: Efficiency is maximized, any change will reduce efficiency
		- protect students by putting nets
			- Problem: Students suicide
			- Compensation: Nets to prevent suicide
			- Status Quo: No mental counselor bcus expensive
	- Outright Illegal Lies
		- Non-profit organization

 
When school and mind convulge:
- Like the arcane jinx mental breakdown scenes
	- The scribble 60 fps Xs and monsters hallucinations

Parents:
- "What will the colleges think when they see your medical history?"
- "I survived school, why cant you?"
- "I didnt give birth to you to let you cause trouble"
- "I swear you will be the death of me"
- "You're lucky I dont abuse you"
- "I'll love you when you start to be useful"
- "good grades should be your priority, not some made up story and excuses"
- "you shouldve prepared instead of playing with your friends all the time"
- Each dialogue above is represented by a knife that shoots to your feet

~~### Wackos~~
- Keep track of the focal points on each scene, and put a figure at the edge of their peripheral vision, it'll surely fuck with 'em' (dead space always looking at health bar so jumpscares inserted at those general area)
- (Influenced by dune) a desert scene with sandstorm, coming for you. could also be snowstorm
- (influenced by finding hope) the 3 am album, dont look at it cus its nothing like a sandstorm. Just try to think of it at the top of your head. The main problem i think would be the particle sim, too much gpu maybe. ([reference](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwallpaperaccess.com%2Fsandstorm&psig=AOvVaw1upUNwJhNXAOGAZEpiDez6&ust=1639784175595000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCKDC9a6-6fQCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE))

Monsters everywhere, (beside every person, monsters stare at you and your lil pet)
