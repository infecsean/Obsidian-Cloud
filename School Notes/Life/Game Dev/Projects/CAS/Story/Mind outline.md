- TV show/video game characters as idols
- Guide

Environment
- At the start, there is a floating island floating freely
- As more comfort zones appear, there will be terrain surrounding the island
- There will also be chains (thinking whether they should appear as the comfort zones are established or as they become more harmful) attached to the island from the three comfort zones
- (hall of shame will probably be somewhere forbidden, like when you zipline you see it but you cant go to it)
- speaking of, the player will be able to zipline down to the zones
	- zones: 
		- Tree of knowledge
		- Swamp (bathroom)
		- (could be combined with swamp cus its also water) waterfall places and mountain
		- mushroom forest? (swamp as well, just look at the reference pictures)
		- [tobedecided] i mean it could be discarded, but what floating island is held down by two fucking chains and not three???
- this is very nice because i really want the "that wasn't there before" scene (looking at tree of knowledge)
- As the game ends, the player ziplines down and the chains break or something, either by the character, to show activeness, or by itself, showing chaos crushing dreams.
	- also i wanna include a scene where the charcter is trying to head straight for the tree, but is interrupted by the zipline breaking, leaving him in the swamp or forest, showing him losing control, or forcing him out of his imagination, interrupted by real life
- The game ends when all the chains are broken, and he watches as his cloud kingdom falls apart
