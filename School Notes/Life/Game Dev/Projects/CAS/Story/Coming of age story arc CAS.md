### Phase 1: Starting in the child world
He starts in his own imaginary utopian world, where he has friends, candy, 
We start in the child world, where his grandpa has always been taking care of him.
He was raised within grandpa's bubble and as such, safe from all harm.
His parents love him but are too busy to look after him.
As a result, they didn't really have a relationship much

the problem now is to fucking tell this to the player somehow without ruining immersion
Approaches:
	- Cutscene
		- Show a cutscene that tells the story
			- Pros
				- If well-made, might actually be okay
			- Cons
				- If shit, shit
				- Kinda ruin immersion i guess (tho everybody does it)
	- Text
		- Pros
			- Easy to make
		- Cons
			- What the fuck
	- Story
		- Pros
			- If done well will probably be revolutionary
		- Cons
			- Hard to do without seeming forced

### Phase 2: Catalyst
Instead of labeling this as a catalyst, it is a tragedy.
His grandpa DIES, and he isnt "pushed" or "called (to adventure)", but FORCED.
I chose to force him because he is prematurely exposed to many challenges at once.
NON OF WHICH he can handle.
This is used to emphasize the pure chaos and things of society thru all the worst experiences one could have: manipulative parents, fragile innocent child, strict rules and fully obedient students

### Phase 3: Entering the adult world
Enter the real world, the herald being the education system
He looks up to the education system, not knowing its power


### Phase 4: The turning point
Moment of truth, when he takes the test.
The results come out good, but not enough.
Due to the premature release instead fo a catalyst in phase 1, this hits him hard asf.

This is also the phase where expectations start to break down, dilusions start to be clear

He start searching for comfort at school, all the comfort zone previously established gone.

Challenges: Get comfort, get good with family, 


### Phase 5: Establish their Independence
In this phase, mc is more focused on a goal.
Instead of focusing on a successful goal, he focuses on his comfort.
He tries to save his own world from falling apart, tries to restore color

He switches to being active.

### Phase 6: A foot in each world
He desperately tries to save his world all while his family is against him.
Finally, the final blow to him. Is the destruction of his childhood and dreams.

### Phase 7: Coming of age
he is now "independent", losing his dreams and all comfort.
He realize that he cannot save himself.
