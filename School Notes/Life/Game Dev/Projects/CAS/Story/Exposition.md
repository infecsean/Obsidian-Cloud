# Exposition
---
- Always (probably) answer a question and then raise another question. Dont just use it to explain something, feels kinda cringe [screencraft article](https://screencraft.org/blog/simple-way-to-make-dream-sequences-and-flashbacks-work/)
>Don't use dream sequences or flashbacks as cheats. If you're going to implement them, ==use them **as a way** to tell your story== — as opposed to using them as an explanation for a character or story point.
- If you dont need it for ==story, plot, or character arcs==, DONT include them [another screencraft article](https://screencraft.org/blog/three-easy-ways-to-write-good-exposition-in-your-scripts/)
	- **Spread Exposition Thin, Not Thick — Trust and Respect the Audience**
	- **Inject Exposition into Compelling, Engaging, and Surprising Moments and Reveals**
	- **Have Characters Argue About the Exposition**
