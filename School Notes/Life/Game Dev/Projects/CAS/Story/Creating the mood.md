# Brainstorming
---
What am I envisioning?
- The dream world needs to contrast with the real world strongly, otherwise it would fail to make the players like that space.
- My vision is for the final result to be
	- A place the player can stay in idle and (This is something I really struggle to find in other games)
		- not be rushed to complete any objective
		- not under any pressure
		- enjoy the present (make the present enjoyable)
		- but also not required to be here,
		- let them know that this is a safe place that they wont have to face their problems
	- Where the player WANTS to go whenever they are under pressure in school or whatever
	-
