# Story of the game
---
### Things to keep in mind
Social anxiety is supposed to be continuous, no jumpscare, just pure paranoia.

### Ideas for progression
The windows will be fully lit at the start school, but slowly dim as you progress
Your mind is utilitarian, meaning that they will always tell you what you want to do, that is within your comfort zone
Everybody is a social reject, every table in the library is occupied, with ONE person.
- Risky idea: (But creative), the first playthrough, you dont get to choose what you do, but you just have to follow your mind, stay inside the comfort zone. The second playthrough, you can change your decisions, 


### Intro
School starts, you enter the first chapter

### Chapter 1, Flowers and Rainbows

### Chapter 2, Social Anxiety
```Context
You meet people, but social anxiety says otherwise
Setting: Hallway -> Classroom
```

Setting: In the hallway
```
The bullies look at you, the bullied is on the floor, almost becomes fully consumed
You now make a choice,  to save him, or to ignore him
Choose between two paths, one, very dark, but you get to save him, or two, its very bright, and you ignore
