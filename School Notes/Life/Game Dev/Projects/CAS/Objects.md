# Objects accesible from inventory
---
### Mask
- The mask is given to you in chapter 1 by "mother"
	- Note from self, if its given by mother it wouldnt make sense, since the bipolar identity is supposed to be self-discovered. So it would be better to find it on ground or something. 
Effects
- Wear it to gain a short period of safeness from anxiety, but its durability will slowly deplete


### Headphones
- Make the players' lives easier with the headphones, so give it to them half way, so that they feel comfortable and attached to the accessory
- When parents take it back soon thereafter, they will cry lol
