Stress meter starting to overflow, and you are pompted to go somewhere alone

You go to the bathroom, the stall leads to your mind dimension

You travel into your mind world, and in contrast to the dream world, its getting darker

Utopian world that is being filled with books (With more and more books, they serve as bridges, and they will soon lead you to the "sacred tree")

Introduce player to mind stuff:
- In the distance, there is a big tree, with a bunch of "fruits"
