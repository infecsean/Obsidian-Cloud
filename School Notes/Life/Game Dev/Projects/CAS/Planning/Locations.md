Whenever you enter a new area, words will fade in saying "Library", "Home"?

### School peripherals
School Gate

### School building
School built like a fuckin castle, surrounded by water, to both prevent escape and suicide
B1F - Cafeteria & Convenience Store
1F - Lobby
2F - Classroom
3F - Classroom
The abandoned classroom - vandalized with quotes
	- "Education is the most powerful weapon to ~~change the world~~ kill children"
	- "Education is not the key to life, but ~~life~~ death"
	- "Practice makes ~~perfect~~ inescapable death loops"
	- "would you jump off a cliff i someone asks you to?"
	- "nothing is impossible, but you're the one talking"
	- "all roads lead to ~~rome~~ death"

### mind
- You are prompted avilability to travel there when nobody is nearby, cus they enduce anxiety, (prolly a good way to break the fourth wall, reveal that the teleporter is effected by your anxiety meter)
- Your subconscious in general
- Its dark and filled with depression
- Transitions to a mountain and a volcano which transitions to the following scene

### Volcano
- Uphill always
~~- The diploma is on the top~~
- So is the tree of knowledge?
- but the road becomes tighter and tighter
- You really cant miss a step, or else youre fucked
- Rope attached to the top of a spikey cliff to the middle, where the tree is located

### Plane of Shame
- Classmates
- Angry Parents

Symbolism needed:
- something to represent how much school has destroyed your hopes and dreams
- landscape that has a strong contrast before and after school started and also escalation
- volumetric fog that increases as things escalate
- absurdity of school (volcano thin line)
