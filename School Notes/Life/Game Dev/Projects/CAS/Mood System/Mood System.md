3. Interaction System
4. Dialogue System

### Why is this needed?
Arguments
- Tell a story on an emotional level?
	- cant that just be done by simple dialogue
	- yeah i guess

Counterarguments
- wouldnt that make the player think that you think theyre dumb?
	- yeah, for not knowing the emotions, by being too on the nose
	- EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ON-THE-NOSE thing is to be unexpected
	- So how we gonna make them think theyre smart?
		- first step at least, dont make a prompt like "you are sad", stuff that tells obvious things or common sense
		- secondly, make the system interact not in an expected way, but rather as a living system that the player has to figure out what is happening
		- MAKE THE SYSTEM FEEL SMAAART

Problems
- Emotions arent subjective
	- Nothing is
		- This is more invasive if you were to tell the player what to feel
		- they wont question it if

### Features
- Interact with environment
	- When you enter a depressing environment you feel sad
		- Great way (i think) of presenting change of how character interprets the world
	- When you overhear a conversation you can get 
	- When you see something terrifying/exciting
- Masking stuff out
	- Q: wouldnt masking be tedious for all 8 emotions?
		- A: solution: use more common emotions for masking (Joy/Sad, Fear/Anger)
		- Q: What about the other 4? (trust/disgust, surprise/anticipation)
			- A: might need a clever approach to this such as a **hidden system** or sumthn
