# Breakdown Time AHHHH
---

```
Scene 1: Mom drops you off at ur first day of school
```
Process:
1. Create ground mesh and landscape
2. create trees
3. create grass
4. god rays
5. game elements and cutscene
6. interactions

Vision:
You walk in, it is very beautiful.
Scene: Cherry blossoms, god rays.


```
Scene : Desert scene
```
Process:
1. Create ground mesh from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9pv0rXS4Lg&ab_channel=PurpleLight)
2. create volumetric fog or like a sandy visual vibe y'know?
3. THEN, create the sandstorm

dont think too complicated, just get the mesh, get normal map, get image filtering, and get sandstorm

worst case scenario, get the clouds project from sebastian and modify it.

Vision:
The mad max scene
but you see it from within the school behind the front door

Bugs: z-fighting
Attempt: 
- Use .tga file
- change motion vector scale [here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/motion-vector-map-makes-flipbook-animation-flicker.902018/)
- change the scale i guess
- change the amount of particles
- test with another project with [this](https://jangafx.com/software/embergen/download/free-vdb-animations/)
- test with OpenVDBUnity (be careful its a fuckin volume simulation)
