This is theoretical but this is the route I would think could work best:

-   Get yourself a good advertiser. Failing that, pay a few different advertisement places to boost the visibility of your game. If they do a good job, someone somewhere will eventually get interested.
    
-   Get people interested by giving out demos. Make sure the demos don't actually have the full game and cannot be hacked into. It might require physically removing content past a certain point and adding in-game barriers. It sucks to do things this way, but you're promoting the full game not the demo.
    
-   You want to write technical articles on your game? Depends on what you made it with and what information you're trying to share. I would definitely wait to see if your game turns out to be popular first, then other developers will naturally have an interest in what you've made. That's when you can worry about sharing information and choosing what to tell them.
