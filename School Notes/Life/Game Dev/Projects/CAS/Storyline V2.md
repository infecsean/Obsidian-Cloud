# Storyline V2
---
### Things to keep in mind
Social anxiety is supposed to be continuous, no jumpscare, just pure paranoia.
The narrater is the voice in your head, your subconscious.
- Tho the purpose is to tell an experience, there still has to be some sort of failing in each chapter/level
- Ask yourself "How is this a good segway into the next chapter?"
- =="if the player knows what to expect, they will get bored"==

### Ideas for progression
The windows will be fully lit at the start school, but slowly dim as you progress
Your mind is utilitarian, meaning that they will always tell you what you want to do, that is within your comfort zone
- Everybody is a social reject, every table in the library is occupied, with ONE person.
- I guess you suffer from episodes where you travel to places in your mind
~~- the place is a giant desert or something~~
- only scene one is in the cherry blossom field to symbolize peace and blissful ignorance
- ~~mirrors: in the beginning you see your reflections call you names, in the end you shatter all the mirrors, no insecurities ;)~~
- you have to be PERFECT, cant get into a good school otherwise (volcano thin rope walk)
- Expectations and responsibilities are presented: take something similar to brim's boulder in die for you, maybe something grand. "mount neverrest"
- Omori's "stab omori" [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUDGlEWa4sE&ab_channel=DarylTalksGames) give the player a thing they cant turn back from, like the needle to the eye from dead space or heavy rain where you have to mutilate yourself to save your son. "force you to do uncomfortable things to progress" milgram experiment
- When in stress, press "e", does a coin flip. from rosencrants and guildenstern are dead: Tension can be created with the repeating chance of flipping a head!
- Maybe it is revealed at the end that you are already dead and reliving the school life
- Make the player feel utter loneliness
- The lil pet grows throughout the chapters
- ==You are given a mask, wear it when you feel unsafe and insecure== make the mask a bit more interesting than just a buff that allows immunity
- You are only given a small amount of time to be mentally there, cus school takes up a that much time. So when the player are sent to the dimension, intentionally design the time limit so that they cant reach a deep enough part (underlying darkness, strange fruit) maybe do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqlHpPzS22U&t=74s&ab_channel=Brackeys)
- THE TREE OF LIFE ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN GROWS FRUIT, WHILE OTHER TREES ONLY GROW ONCE, MEANING PEOPLE SUICIDE ALL THE TIME, WHILE FRUIT GROWS SLOWLY
- You can only see the tree of life from afar, everytime you see a fruit, there is a person getting it off, but moments later they put a kind of defense around it to keep people out.
- 2 inventories, mental and real world
- The roof is off limits, which restricts escape. Once the roof is free, ~~you watch from afar~~ directly involve, students go to the roof, you watch them jump into the river, ~~thinking they will all escape~~ knowing that they will all die, but it is the lesser evil.


### Wackos
- Keep track of the focal points on each scene, and put a figure at the edge of their peripheral vision, it'll surely fuck with 'em' (dead space always looking at health bar so jumpscares inserted at those general area)
- (Influenced by dune) a desert scene with sandstorm, coming for you. could also be snowstorm
- (influenced by finding hope) the 3 am album, dont look at it cus its nothing like a sandstorm. Just try to think of it at the top of your head. The main problem i think would be the particle sim, too much gpu maybe.

- inspiration: ![[nightmare artist walk of shame.jpeg|400]]

(unsure) the announcer announces your scores, you hear everything
you look at your future, there is no light ahead.

"if you cant be strong now, how the fuck are you going to survive out there?"
"dont find excuses for your mistakes"
"EXCUSES, EXCUSES, EXCUSES"

Your only way is to the side, uphill

### Chapter 10, Up
```Context
You start running up
Setting: Bookland volcano
```
You run through to bookland
You start running up to the top
On the way, you rip (like between dimensions) between stairs and bookland

You are given a dark matter gun
On one hand, you are running from depression,
On the other hand, you are running from school stress,

The ending is that you fully embrace darkness, let is consume you

### Chapter 11, Kill
```Context
Darkness catches up
Setting: You need to kill announcer
```
The door that leads to white space is right in front of you
You can grab the diploma, but you can only open it with an empty hand, so you unequip the diploma, but the door tells you to kill your pet. (You cant get thru school without killing yourself).
