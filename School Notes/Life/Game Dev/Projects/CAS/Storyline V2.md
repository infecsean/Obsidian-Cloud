# Storyline V2

### Things to keep in mind
Social anxiety is supposed to be continuous, no jumpscare, just pure paranoia.
The narrater is the voice in your head, your subconscious.
- Tho the purpose is to tell an experience, there still has to be some sort of failing in each chapter/level
- Ask yourself "How is this a good segway into the next chapter?"

### Ideas for progression
The windows will be fully lit at the start school, but slowly dim as you progress
Your mind is utilitarian, meaning that they will always tell you what you want to do, that is within your comfort zone
Everybody is a social reject, every table in the library is occupied, with ONE person.
- I guess you suffer from episodes where you travel to places in your mind
- the place is a giant desert or something
- only scene one is in the cherry blossom field to symbolize peace and blissful ignorance
- mirrors: in the beginning you see your reflections call you names, in the end you shatter all the mirrors, no insecurities ;)
- you have to be PERFECT, cant get into a good school otherwise
- Expectations and responsibilities are presented: take something similar to brim's boulder in die for you, maybe something grand. "mount neverrest"


### Wackos
- Keep track of the focal points on each scene, and put a figure at the edge of their peripheral vision, it'll surely fuck with 'em'
- (Influenced by dune) a desert scene with sandstorm, coming for you. could also be snowstorm
- (influenced by finding hope) the 3 am album, dont look at it cus its nothing like a sandstorm. Just try to think of it at the top of your head. The main problem i think would be the particle sim, too much gpu maybe.

### Intro
School starts, you enter the first chapter

### Chapter 1, First Day
```Context
First day of school, you are on your way to class
Setting: Mom drops you off at school
```
Mom drops you off at school
The scene is nice and colorful
you need to go to your classroom
You go there

### Chapter 2, Social Anxiety (No)
```Context
You meet people, but social anxiety says otherwise
Setting: Hallway -> Classroom
```
Avoid eye contact
You notice everyone is wearing a mask
Someone approaches you i guess


### Chapter 3, Change of Priorities
```Context
The announcer has something to say apparently
Setting: Seated at your desk
```
Announcer introduces yall to the school
"You will have to put your trust in us, as we will teach you EVERYTHING, and by everything, we MEAN EVERYTHING..., in the meantime, make some friends, and have fun"
Something drops down
A stack of books, weights, and waaaaay on top of that, is your diploma.
- travel to book land???

### Chapter 4, Ignorance is bliss (good point but remove bully)
```Context
The player gets to make their first choice, to help others, or help themselves
Effects if help: Pure mindedness
Effects if no help: He becomes a school shooter, you watch him get beaten up later on in other chapters
Setting: In the hallway
```
The bullies look at you, the bullied is on the floor, almost becomes fully consumed
You now make a choice,  to save him, or to ignore him
Choose between two paths, one, very dark, but you get to save him, or two, its very bright, and you ignore

Also, the announcer "During the school year, we want our students to have the best learning experience ever! To ensure that you are working at your best, we have a rule that drugs, entertainment, and death is strictly forbidden!"

### Chapter 5, Liberary (nice concept but could merge)
```Context
Its pretty crowded in here, your social anxiety is off the roof
Dont make any noise
Setting: Library
```
You needed to get a book from the librarian.
You arrive at the library, but you cant even make a single sound, just ignore the noisy stuff, and walk.
After the stealth, you exit the library
Its now lunch time, you head to the cafeteria

### Chapter 6, Survival (this is just uncalled for)
```Context
its lunch time! Go get some food
Setting: Cafeteria, no, Convenience store
```
Its lunch time! Go get some food.
The cafeteria is full of people, who are looking at you
You go to the convenience store, buys some other stuff
You also see some medication for depression, and knife
You walk out, but your mind stops you, "What, you gonna eat that cold?"
"you suppose I ask him to microwave it?"

### Chapter 7, Pressure Test (good idea, needs modification for effective implementation)
```Context
The pressure of getting bad grades, 
Setting: Classroom, library
```
The announcer says that there will be five tests tomorrow
You walk out of the classroom and straight to the library, the path will be textured as pages of tests and books.
You walk around to find every table is occupied by one person, and so you walk back, take the test.
You get a bad grade
*Gradient transition into your mind, sorrow*

### Chapter 8, Expectations
```Context
The books seem to grow taller and taller, it becomes unreachable, you cant seem to reach it
Setting: Plane of consciousness, classroom
```
You get out of your mind, into the classroom, you walk to get your test paper.
You look at your horrible test score, you walk the walk of shame.

- travel to walk of shame where everybody is enlarged and turned into scary figures and you have to walk thru the entire thing
- inspiration: ![[nightmare artist walk of shame.jpeg]]
everybody looks at you, laughs
your parents look at you, angry
(unsure) the announcer announces your scores, you hear everything
you look at your future, there is no light ahead.

You scream, but you cant, you try to run away, but you are frozen

### Chapter 9, Depression (Unsure)
```Context
You are consumed by the dark
Setting: Hallways
```
You walk in the dark, and the big guy comes in, (representation of depression)
You can walk towards him, be consumed. You can run away, he will chase you down. You can ignore him, as other people walk towards it and towards suicide. (prollly last one)
You suddenly hear the school bell rings...school is over
it follows you to the dorms

### Chapter 10, To the Dorms
```Context
You finally go back to the dorms
The sun shines thru the window, but it kinda feels off
Setting: The dorms
```
You head to the dorms, with weight on your back
Drugs: you escaped into wonderland! Everything is good here.
Rope: Youve had enough, you give up
"Dont worry, death is inevitable"

Two paths, one with parkour, to "help", the other, straight path, to drugs. Merchant under a spotlight.

### Chapter 11, Dire Docks
```Context
You desparately try to find a way out
Setting: A small dock, where a boat and person is
```
Behind you is the depression, in front is a light, a boat which you can just sail and leave depression. But no.
Your boat is crushed, the announcer "you think you can just leave?"
The darkness fills in, the sun bleeds black, the water full of red eyes


### Chapter 12,
