# Sandstorm Problems
---
### Karasusan OpenVDB for unity
- Need to change to HDRP
- May not be able to animate frames
- idk if it even works

### Flipbook
- Only a 2D plane not really cool looking
- Need to work with VFX graphs (which may not be a bad thing)
- Sucks overall
- looks kinda unprofessional since i need it to be the focal point
- need to change to another vision that dont involve sandstorm as focal point

### Use VFX graph on simple meshes
- May be simplified, too simplified
- not the style im going for
- weird but again, arent we all
