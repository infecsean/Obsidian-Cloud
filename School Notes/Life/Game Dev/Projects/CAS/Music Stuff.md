# Music and stuff

### Notes
- The end song would probably be more upbeat, connection with death of the character. [inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urxeNbBc1nk&ab_channel=vivivivivi), (read the comment section of the vid its so good for mood). Here are some for example:
	- Feels like the song of a game that has insane buildup to a final boss just for the battle to start, and the protagonist to realize how fucked they are, and as they tried to fight the boss, clinging to life trying to beat that boss, as they realize, theres nothing they can do, and they slowly succumb to their death as the credits play
- hopelessly optimistic as [Tubbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AFxipPfPv0&ab_channel=TUBBO%26FRIENDSCLIPS) said while playing "fallen down" by toby fox
- on that note, also get inspiration from fallen down lol, comfort the player after death
- Everything else is just heavy reese bass and i cant forget you kinda vibes, only ending music is very upbeat and catchy, saying that it is actually better off after death. Like a celebration of death, that it doesnt have to be sad.
