### Character arcs
- Create different characters with mostly the same traits, but a little make-or-break property to show what might potentially happen should you go down the same path
	- Characters that have ideologies that revolves around others will be weaker since they are fighting for others

### Conflict
- Drama is created by the status quo
	- If the status quo is changed, drama is created
	- that is, if you creating a horror movie
- Drama in arcane is created by the status quo not changing
	- people who are willing to prevent the status quo from changing - Sevika

### For companions

Companions people care about
- Have to have ==Desires== and ==Flaws==
	- in fiction, flaws work best when ==common== and ==forgivable==
	- personality flaws (not necessarily) affect the main character (ex. recklessness)
	- characters that have made the same stupid mistakes you have
- A balanced companion that ==doesnt get in the player's way== and ==not invulnerable==
	- A companion that the player relies on can sometimes be good as it ==highlights== (hah) the importance of them
	- The latter is better than the former
	- add human elements (==creates a sense that they can act independently of you==)
