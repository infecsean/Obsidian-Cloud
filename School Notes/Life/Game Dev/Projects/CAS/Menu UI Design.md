### Main Menu
- Dont have many elements fight for your attention
- Highlight your most important feature
- After making the menu, ask yourself, from the perspective of a consumer (like in the video 5:51)
- Consistent graphic style

### HUD

- ==Gauges:== What we think about when people say "HUD"
	- Taking information that is invisible and showing it to the player
- ==Previews:== Indicator that shows up to tell the player something
	- Give players a heads-up about the consequences of the actions they may take before they commit
- ==Cognitive load==: The human brain can only juggle so much info in the current memory
	- The more junk is on the screen, the more unpleasant the game will be to play
		- Eye tracking tech is the solution
		- Cut back useless information
	- Be clever with the layout, ensure the elements that is on screen is ==relevant== & ==digestible==.
- ==Visual Hierarchy==: Things like Font Weight, Color, Position, Scale, Motion
	- Make more important things stand out more than useless things
	- Avoid Critical information being ignored
- ==Three Reads==: Technique to check if done right
	- First read: Most important, Main game element
	- Second Read: Big critical rules that are vital to gameplay (make or break your run)
	- Third read: Less important stuff, like small contextual rules
- ==Solutions==:
	- Hide all UI and show only when necessary
	- OR, [[Diegesis|Diegetic]] UI, meaning they are part of your world
