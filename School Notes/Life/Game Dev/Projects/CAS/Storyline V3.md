### Chapter 2, Anxiety
```Context
The announcer has something to say apparently
Setting: Seated at your desk
```

Announcer introduces yall to the school
"You will have to put your trust in us, as we will teach you EVERYTHING, and by everything, we MEAN EVERYTHING..., in the meantime, make some friends, and have fun"
"while you still can..."

Something drops down
A stack of books, weights, and waaaaay on top of that, is your diploma.

```

Amongst the giant pile of books, you begin to feel hopelessness.
Stress meter starting to overflow, and you are pompted to go somewhere alone

You go to the bathroom, the stall leads to your mind dimension

You travel into your mind world, and in contrast to the dream world, its getting darker

Utopian world that is being filled with books (With more and more books, they serve as bridges, and they will soon lead you to the "sacred tree")

Introduce player to mind stuff:
- In the distance, there is a big tree, with a bunch of "fruits"
	- You walk to a wall, there is an enscription showing the sacredness of the tree
- Wait until morning, for it is too dangerous to go at night (wait until you calm down)
- When its almost sunrise, you are jumped back to the bathroom, someone flushing
- You are prompted to go to the library to study book 1 and 2

Its now lunch time, you head to the cafeteria (b1)
Monsters everywhere

You give them the food you wanna buy and bolt


### Chapter 5, Pressure Test (good idea, needs modification for effective implementation)
```Context
The pressure of getting bad grades, 
Setting: Classroom, library
```
The announcer says that there will be five tests tomorrow
You walk out of the classroom and straight to the library, the path will be textured as pages of tests and books.
OR just travel to *insert book land*
You walk around to find every table is occupied by one person, and so you walk back, take the test.
You get a bad grade
*Gradient transition into your mind, sorrow*
Transitions into the plane of shame

### Chapter 6, Expectations
```Context
The books seem to grow taller and taller, it becomes unreachable, you cant seem to reach it
Setting: Plane of consciousness, classroom
```
You get out of your mind, into the classroom, you walk to get your test paper.
You look at your horrible test score, you walk the walk of shame.

=="Insanity, is doing the same fucking thing over and over again, and expecting shit to change"== 

- travel to walk of shame where everybody is enlarged and turned into scary figures and you have to walk thru the entire thing
- inspiration: ![[nightmare artist walk of shame.jpeg|400]]
everybody looks at you, laughs
(unsure) the announcer announces your scores, you hear everything
you look at your future, there is no light ahead.
Everybody is one of those giant statues.
You see your house, you run inside
You cry and run home to your parents, looking for comfort
~~You scream, but you cant, you try to run away, but you are frozen~~


### Chapter 7, Comfort
```Context
You walk back home
Setting: Home
```
You meet with your parents

You talk about your depression
Your parents says its nonsense
*insert parents' ignorance to depressed children*
"if i could do it at my time, you can do it"
"dont worry, im a doctor, you dont have depression"
"if you cant be strong now, how the fuck are you going to survive out there?"
"dont find excuses for your mistakes"
"EXCUSES, EXCUSES, EXCUSES"
They are angry, they say you are having too much fun (insert parent depriving you of everything that is keeping you alive at the moment)(for instance your mask)
"GO TO YOUR ROOM"

Your family becomes demons (requires you to wear mask)
you go to your room
- New objective: Find a knife



### Chapter 9, dock cock
```Context
You desparately try to find a way out
Setting: A small dock, where a boat and person is
```
Behind you is the depression, in front is a light, a boat which you can just sail and leave depression. But no.
Your boat is crushed, the announcer "you think you can just leave?"
The darkness fills in, the sun bleeds black, the water full of red eyes
Your only way is to the side, uphill

### Chapter 10, Up
```Context
You start running up
Setting: Bookland volcano
```
You run through to bookland
You start running up to the top
On the way, you rip (like between dimensions) between stairs and bookland
~~On top, you see light
You are given a dark matter gun~~
On one hand, you are running from depression,
On the other hand, you are running from school stress,

The ending is that you fully embrace darkness, let is consume you

### Chapter 11, Kill
```Context
Darkness catches up
Setting: You need to kill announcer
```
The door that leads to white space is right in front of you
You can grab the diploma, but you can only open it with an empty hand, so you unequip the diploma, but the door tells you to kill your pet. (You cant get thru school without killing yourself).
You either shoot the pet (yourself) and die or destroy the diploma and embrace darkness.

### Chapter 12, Blank
```Context
White Space
Setting: White Space
```
You enter white space. Everything is nice.
Cherry blossoms, your pet, and your grave.

You sit at home with a rope ready.
You see the newspaper headlines "School prohibits death in response to suicide spree"
