Whenever you enter a new area, words will fade in saying "Library", "Home", or %!^#\*! for subconsciousness areas

Enters to entrance of school, it is surrounded by water, cross a bridge to get to the school

### School peripherals
The gate with cherry blossoms
leads into the school building

### School building
School built like a fuckin castle, surrounded by water, to both prevent escape and suicide
B1F - Cafeteria & Convenience Store
1F - Lobby
2F - Classroom
3F - Classroom
4F - Classroom
The classroom of truth - vandalized classroom with quotes
	- "Education is the most powerful weapon to ~~change the world~~ kill children"
	- "Education is not the key to life, but ~~life~~ death"
	- "Practice makes ~~perfect~~ inescapable death loops"
	- "would you jump off a cliff i someone asks you to?"
	- "nothing is impossible, but you're the one talking"
	- "all roads lead to ~~rome~~ death"

- Its dark and filled with depression
- Transitions to a mountain and a volcano which transitions to the following scene

### Volcano
- Uphill always
- The diploma is on the top

- You really cant miss a step, or else youre fucked

### Plane of Shame
- Classmates
