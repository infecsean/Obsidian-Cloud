### Book land (srsly change it)

- Transitions to a mountain and a volcano which transitions to the following scene

### Volcano
- Uphill always
- The diploma is on the top
- but the road becomes tighter and tighter
- You really cant miss a step, or else youre fucked

### Plane of Shame
- Classmates
- Angry Parents
- everytime you have to kill or harm yourself to leave
