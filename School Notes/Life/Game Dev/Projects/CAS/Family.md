### Five rules of parenting (in arcane)
1. Use family to integrate themes
	- How parents guide their children (what to do with anger)
		- control the monster
		- let the monster out
		- ignore the monster
	- dont write orphans
2. Use Family dynamics as templates for arcs
	- Parents protect child -> Child protect parent -> parent deal with rebellious -> parents dont understand child
	- power struggle: parent have more power, child's recklessness ends up being completely opposite to parent's expectations
	- What a child does will not only carry the weight of consequences, but also their relationships with their parents
3. Use family roles to make audience's relationships with characters complex
	- Come into conflict with their greater roles/idealism
	- play with power dynamics to show flaws
4. Use family to create social barriers
	- Diverge from original path or set path
5. Use family to force difficult decisions that crystalize values
	- To show their true selves, create dfficult decisions
	- What is more valuable to them? Ideology or family?
