# Game design document
---
-   Prototype. what it will contain
	-   General map layout, so build that
-   The idea or concept
	- Since im gonna make a story based game, the hook or the selling point of my game should be the artstyle, not "Cool game mechanics"
	- through progression and the choices you make, you become one of "them"
	- Mental enemies if you defeat them once, you overcome them
-   Genre and setting
	- horror idk
	- could also be open world (but then would have to encourage exploration)
	- Need to be set in a school (Where player will spend most of the time)
	- Could be mingdao inspired (Racks become a football field or smthn, )
-   Story and characters
	-   player is maybe transfer student or something idk
-   Core game mechanics
	-   Progression system: 

      

### Include a disclaimer pls
How fucking ironic this is, I’m 17 making a possibly 18+ game. 

### Name idea
To the dorms - cus the player will mostly be on their way to the dorms

  

  

### Questions that I ask myself: 
do I wanna put the scores that the student has on their own hands? Like do the players decide what grade they get with their actions?

No

Does this make the school kinda like a cult?
Yeah maybe

### How did this dystopian school come to be?
Maybe he stayed in a coma for 20 years idk
Maybe this is just an everyday thing and the school is set as a mental world, the stream of consciousness if you will.
  

### Setting
Build a school campus

You are a straight a student
You live near school (student dorm)
So you study at the library late everyday

In a game design perspective, the part above means that the player will only be walking around at night

  

### Progression

In the form of nights - kinda like five nights at Freddy’s, but different nights have different encounters
Exploration like soma, but we recycle the map by integrating different nights and encounters.

  

### Locations
Dorm - player will go there every night
School 
	- Buncha classrooms
	- bathrooms
	- head office (maybe bossroom),
Convenience store - sells medication, food, supplies
Flag pole or sumthin - A symbol of worship of sorts
Park - the seems-to-be "safe" place.


**Characters** 
**Idea: if they are under control, the are robots, if not, then humans**
Humans:
your friend - which will represent you in the third person as you watch him get completely taken over
School shooters - they’ve had enough of this school, and life in general
School bullies - they haven’t seen you as a target ( less like bullies and more like mafia) 
Teachers - Spine device controls. 
Principal - Enthusiastic tone with dark actions
Janitor - 

  

  

### Events
Mugging - at night around the dorms

School shooting - At the school probably

Chase scene by the enemies

Suicides - happens every other day

Bullying - People getting pushed around at night. May be one of the endings, be the bully, or be the bullied.

Drug trade - students are too stressed

  

**Scripted events**
