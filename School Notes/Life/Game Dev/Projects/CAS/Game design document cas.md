# Game design document
---
-   Prototype. what it will contain
	-   General map layout, so build that
-   The idea or concept
	- Since im gonna make a story based game, the hook or the selling point of my game should be the artstyle, not "Cool game mechanics"
	- through progression and the choices you make, you become one of "them"
	- ~~Mental enemies if you defeat them once, you overcome them~~
-   Genre and setting
	- horror idk
	- could also be open world (but then would have to encourage exploration)
	- Need to be set in a school (Where player will spend most of the time)
	- Could be mingdao inspired (Racks become a football field or smthn, )
-   Story and characters
	-   player is maybe transfer student or something idk
-   Core game mechanics
	-   Progression system: 

-   Release the game on Steam and charge $2.99 for it. If you release it for $1.00 you cannot discount it more than 50% because steam doesn’t allow games to be cheaper than $0.50. Shoppers set up triggers and wait for 60% and 75% off discounts. You need to increase your price so you have the room to discount it.
-   You must add customizable controls. It is good for accessibility, Steam players expect it, and it is code that you can reuse in your next full sized game.
-   You must add achievements. Players love achievements. Add at least 26. You will sell more copies because you have achievements.
-   If you can afford it, hire a good artist to make a cover image (in Steam it is called a capsule) for your game. This is very very important. Don’t use a screenshot for your capsule art. I wrote about how a capsule art [change increased sales 20x](https://howtomarketagame.com/2020/04/13/how-one-new-image-increased-sales-by-20x/) for this game and also this article about [how a capsule change increased wishlists big time!](https://howtomarketagame.com/2020/12/21/how-to-increase-your-games-daily-wishlist-rate/)
-   If you can afford it and you are not an artist, pay for good professional game art. Since this is a small game you don’t need much art. I cannot overstate how much art sells games on Steam. People buy games based on graphics. Try your best not to use programmer art. There are also [free art assets here](https://opengameart.org/) and [perfectly reasonably priced asset store art.](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/)

### Include a disclaimer pls
How fucking ironic this is, I’m 17 making a possibly 18+ game. 

### Name idea
To the dorms - cus the player will mostly be on their way to the dorms

  
Are you going to go down the road of depression, or hatred? Will you be consumed, or repent, or even escape?
  

### Questions that I ask myself: 
Does this make the school kinda like a cult?
Yeah maybe

### How did this dystopian school come to be?
~~Maybe he stayed in a coma for 20 years idk~~
Maybe this is just an everyday thing and the school is set as a mental world, the stream of consciousness if you will.
  

### Setting
Build a school campus

You are a straight a student
You live near school (student dorm)
~~So you study at the library late everyday~~

~~In a game design perspective, the part above means that the player will only be walking around at night~~

  Changed so this whole game is a stream of consciousness of a student going thru puberty

### Progression

~~In the form of nights - kinda like five nights at Freddy’s, but different nights have different encounters~~
Exploration like soma, but we recycle the map by integrating different nights and encounters.

Mental and physical progression
  

### Locations
Dorm - player will go there every night
School 
	- Buncha classrooms
	- bathrooms
	- head office (maybe bossroom),
Convenience store - sells medication, food, supplies
~~Flag pole or sumthin - A symbol of worship of sorts~~
Cafeteria
~~Park - the seems-to-be "safe" place.~~
DORMS - TO THE DORMS MATE

**Characters** 
~~**Idea: if they are under control, the are robots, if not, then humans**~~
Physical:
Bullied - weak people who get bullied
School shooters - they’ve had enough of this school, and life in general
School bullies - they haven’t seen you as a target ( less like bullies and more like mafia) 
~~Teachers - Spine device controls. ~~
Principal - Enthusiastic tone with dark actions (also act as a guide)
~~Janitor - ~~
Cashier - just a basic guy that only gives a fuck when u buy something

Mental monsters
Big sad - The big guy that sometimes follows you around (gets bigger as you progress)
  

### Events
~~Mugging - at night around the dorms~~

School shooting - At the school probably (At the tracks (last stage (or at least close to the last stage)))

~~Chase scene by the enemies~~

Suicides - happens ~~every other day~~ more often as you progress

Bullying - People getting pushed around at night. May be one of the endings, be the bully, or be the bullied.

~~Drug trade - students are too stressed~~
