# Storyline Plan
---
life, a game, fly's game

### Summary or something
- I want to tell a story of a fly
- Satirising the blind following of humans to oppressors like flies to a rotten corpse
- But a twist - theres a human. He is suicidal.
- Yeah so ultimately, the guy will off himself and the flies will take it as a sign of enlightenment and embrace for the flies, and as a sign of worship, devour him.

### Themes probably
- The value of life
	- Question the player's morals by asking them to think about the purpose of their lives
	- This is done through contrasting the purpose of a fly with the dude
		- Even something as insignificant as a fly has a life purpose - to consume
	- Through a perspective of philosophy of a being that doesn't have to question existence, since they know what they are meant to do in life
	- Contrast with the dude - an almighty being whose life's worth is determined by others, we observe him through a fly, see him grow into different roles - an unlovable boyfriend, an expendable employee, a useless son, a person desperately trying to change, the game that is life
	- A fly came to be because of the beast that is human, who lives in filth and depression and cant be bothered to clean up
- Exploration
	- Encourage exploration through stuff like easter eggs and rewards i guess
	- Exploring the world, while exploring themselves
		- Define sleep zones and feed zones
		- These zones are like bases, which would optimally appear around food.
		- It is within these zones, can you find the ideas of other flies
- Parallel between flies and dude to create empathy
	- Purpose
		- Flies - to consume. Dude - to die
	- Memory
		- Flies will not remember. Dude will
	- Relationship
		- Flies worship dude, dude hate flies
		- Difference between sleep and death
- Purpose of progression
	- Usually used to show that there is a purpose to your actions beyond a direct benefit from others
	- However, a fly's purpose is clear - to consume. What will this mean for a fly? How does he progress and grow in a world where you cannot grow mentally
- Stop going on about themes, the set piece of this game is its story
	- Just make sure theres a storyline that the player can focus on - fly. And a storyline for the dude - relationships n shit. Only sprinkle that philosophical dust sparingly.

### Mechanics planning
- Movement
	- WS to move foward and back when grounded (maggot)
	- WASD to move around when grounded (fly)
	- WASD to move in air and QE to rise or dip
	- Carrying stuff
- Stamina
	- Plenty to use for a day cus it will reset when you sleep
	- Drains when you carry stuff for quests
	- Sleeping mechanic
		- cannot sleep right after being reengergized
		- being awake drains stamina
- Calendar
	- Increases every day - diagetic way to show progression of time
	- Increases every time you sleep - which is a required process when you die and become a maggot
- Bases
	- Contains feeding zones and sleeping zones
- Threats
	- Dude
		- Traps
		- "Divine intervention" aka fly swatters and sprays
		- Death zone
	- Spiders?
		- webs that will kill ya
		- Death zone
- Interacting with the world
	- Other flies
		- Dialogue system
		- Quest system
	- Map
		- show bases

- A flies plot that addresses civilization
- And a plot that addresses this sad dude that is being worshipped by flies
