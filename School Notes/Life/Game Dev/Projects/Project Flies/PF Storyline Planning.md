# Storyline Plan
---

### Summary or something
- I want to tell a story of a fly
- Satirising the blind following of humans to oppressors like flies to a rotten corpse
- But a twist - theres a human. He is suicidal.
- Yeah so ultimately, the guy will off himself and the flies will take it as a sign of enlightenment and embrace for the flies, and as a sign of worship, devour him.

- A flies plot that addresses civilization
- And a plot that addresses this sad dude that is being worshipped by flies
