1.  **The Ordinary World**: We see the hero’s normal life at the start of the story before the adventure begins.
2.  **Call to Adventure**: The hero is faced with an event, conflict, problem, or challenge that makes them begin their adventure.
3.  **Refusal of the Call**: The hero initially refuses the adventure because of hesitation, fears, insecurity, or any other number of issues.
4.  **Meeting the Mentor**: The hero encounters a mentor that can give them advice, wisdom, information, or items that ready them for the journey ahead.
5.  **Crossing the Threshold**: The hero leaves their ordinary world for the first time and crosses the threshold into adventure.
6.  **Tests, Allies, and Enemies**: The hero learns the rules of the new world and endures tests, meets friends, and comes face-to-face with enemies.
7.  **The Approach**: The initial plan to take on the central conflict begins, but setbacks occur that cause the hero to try a new approach or adopt new ideas.
8.  **The Ordeal:** Things go wrong and added conflict is introduced. The hero experiences more difficult hurdles and obstacles, some of which may lead to a life crisis.
9.  **The Reward**: After surviving The Ordeal, the hero seizes _**the sword**_ — a reward that they’ve earned that allows them to take on the biggest conflict. It may be a physical item or piece of knowledge or wisdom that will help them persevere.
10.  **The Road Back**: The hero sees the light at the end of the tunnel, but they are about to face even more tests and challenges.
11.  **The Resurrection**: The climax. The hero faces a final test, using everything they have learned to take on the conflict once and for all.
12.  **The Return**: The hero brings their knowledge or the “elixir” back to the ordinary world.
