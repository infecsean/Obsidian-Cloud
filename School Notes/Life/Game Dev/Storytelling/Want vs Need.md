### Want
- External
- Obstacles are outside
	- eg. other characters, blocking your wants
- Often known to self
- Drives the ==PLOT== 
- the FUN stuff
- unique to character
- Wants need to be backed by stakes
	- shown by obstacles that are in their way

### Need
- Internal
- Obstacles are inside
	- eg. self-doubt, what holds you back
- Often unknown to self (or often rejected by self)
- Drives the ==THEME==
- the HEARTS (connection between character and audience)
- Universal (often might teach the audience a lesson)
- The thing they need to figure out about themselves in order to get the want
