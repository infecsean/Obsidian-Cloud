### Conflict
Plot
- The ==want== will define the goals early in the story, while the ==need== will push them to question these goals
- Good story will have the plot ==reflect== MC's internal conflict, while shaping it
- the pull between the ==want== and the ==need== should be woven into the story
- In [[Life/Game Dev/Storytelling/Story Structure/Three Act Structure/Act 1]], the want will determine their actions, and motivate them to engage with the plot
- at the [[Act 2#Midpoint sauce https thenovelsmithy com story-structure-5-the-midpoint|midpoint]], the want will seem achievable, but they ==cannot== succeed without addressing the ==need==
- [[Act 3]] will push the want out of reach or seem hollow after achieving the want, leading them to ==confront== the need

Reader
- ==THE WANT WILL AFFECT HOW READERS PERCIEVE THE CHARACTER==
- The want gives character ==motivation==, while the ==clearly established need== will give readers something to stick around for
- Knowing the MC has an achievable ==need== makes the reader continue to cheer for the flawed MC
- Often ppl will complain about characters who have ==vague needs==, and ==regularly succeeding==, ==facing no challenges== to their ==inner struggle==. Making their victories feel undeserved
- Consider how much they are willing to ==sacrifice== for their ==want==

### Want
- character's ==desire==, they believe it will bring them ==happiness==
- External solution to internal wounds
- Obstacles are outside
	- eg. other characters, blocking your wants
- Often known to self
- Drives the ==PLOT== 
- the FUN stuff
- unique to character
- Wants need to be backed by stakes
	- shown by obstacles that are in their way

### Need
- The lesson they need to overcome the inner struggle and achieve true happiness
- Internal solution
- Obstacles are inside
	- eg. self-doubt, what holds you back
- Often unknown to self (or often rejected by self)
- Drives the ==THEME==
- the HEARTS (connection between character and audience)
- Universal (often might teach the audience a lesson)
- The thing they need to figure out about themselves in order to get the want

### Inner Struggle
- The damaging belief or thought that MC need to overcome to complete the arc

### Wound
- The deeply influential and negative past experiences that feed their inner struggle

### Truth
- Should directly contrast their inner struggle
- The lesson they need to overcome the inner struggle
