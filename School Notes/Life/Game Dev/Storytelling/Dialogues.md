[Making great dialogues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEgsIV98ZmU&ab_channel=TheCloserLook)
Every Dialogue has to serve a purpose. That is the base of all adequate dialogue.
### Great dialogue, on the other hand
- Would maybe serve several purposes
- Not boring (serves the story/plot)
- Subtext
	- Things that are heavily implied
	- Dialogue that lack subtext tends to feel inauthentic
		- Underestimates the reader's intelligence and ability to understand the subtext
		- Assume the audience cant see through the lines
- Feel confident about their ability to convey the theme
	- Show, Dont tell
