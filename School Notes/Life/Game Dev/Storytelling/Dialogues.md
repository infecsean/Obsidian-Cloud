### AVOID ON THE NOSE DIALOGUE

[Making great dialogues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEgsIV98ZmU&ab_channel=TheCloserLook)
Every Dialogue has to serve a purpose. That is the base of all adequate dialogue.
### Great dialogue, on the other hand
- Would maybe serve several purposes
- Not boring (serves the story/plot)
- Subtext
	- Things that are heavily implied
	- Dialogue that lack subtext tends to feel inauthentic
		- Underestimates the reader's intelligence and ability to understand the subtext
		- Assume the audience cant see through the lines
- Feel confident about their ability to convey the theme
	- Show, Dont tell
- Dialogue shouldnt be the main thing, but rather an icing on the cake

### Real Dialogue

- Since real dialogue we would never get to the point
- But in storytelling, we want to get straight to the point BUT ALSO feel real, which seems impossible
	- 1. Have characters misunderstand each other: One character hears what they wanna hear, then they respond to what they wanna hear, and the twist happen (reality)
		- ==BAD DIALOGUE== is when every character knows what each other is talking about
	- 2. Have the dialogues show the character's personality. ("The spin" in the vid)
		- Their response shows their values. If a person is optimistic, they will respond to every interaction with a bright sided view. 
		- Spin the "generic" dialogue into a character specific line, where we can learn more about the character

- Having overlapping dialogue is really realistic and it shows the complete failure of communication
	- Can use in cas game in interaction between parents and mc
	- in the video where two guys attempt to bond, can use with school interaction when first time make friends

Good dialogue
1. Cut dialogue to the bone. 
2. Use dialogue to reveal backstory. 
3. Use dialogue to reveal character. 
4. Be subtle. (subtext, sidestepping, silence)
5. Read your dialogue aloud. 
6. Create a 'Make My Day' moment.
