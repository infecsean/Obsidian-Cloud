### How to write villains
1. The conflict in humans
	- We should see the temptation to become a villain
2. Mistakes
	- All villains must have an internal motivation
	- you know who believed in hitler? Hitler.
3. The lure of darkness
	- Snowballing lies: You lie one time, lies lies lies
	- Slippery slops: Oh just this once
	- Convince yourself that somehow this is justified (stealing for family)
4. Villains we root for
	- Relatable
5. Creating empathy
	- What is an antihero?
		- A hero who becomes a villain for sympathetic reasons
	- Emotional Impact
		- Make us feel sorry for the character
		- A moment where the charcter is unjustly abused/mistreated/insulted/betrayed
		- Show their humanity/that they care about something other than themselves
		- Admiration: An achievement that is admirable
	- Imperfect
