### How to write villains
1. The conflict in humans
	- We should see the temptation to become a villain
2. Mistakes
	- All villains must have an internal motivation
	- you know who believed in hitler? Hitler.
3. The lure of darkness
	- Snowballing lies: You lie one time, lies lies lies
	- Slippery slops: Oh just this once
	- Convince yourself that somehow this is justified (stealing for family)
4. Villains we root for
	- Relatable
5. Creating empathy
	- What is an antihero?
		- A hero who becomes a villain for sympathetic reasons
	- Emotional Impact
		- Make us feel sorry for the character
		- A moment where the charcter is unjustly abused/mistreated/insulted/betrayed
		- Show their humanity/that they care about something other than themselves
		- Admiration: An achievement that is admirable
	- Imperfect

### Villains i guess
==Motivation:==
- ==Values==: Showing the value behind their motivation help set them apart from other villains.
- ==Scale==: Showing the scale of the motivation help demonstrate the kind of threat they pose.
- Can also have more than one priority, and it can be interesting where they conflict
==Conflict:==
- Finding the right motive to bring the villain into conflict with the hero is important
	- Have their motivation reflect but disagree with the hero's
	- Have them share their motivations that draws them into conflict
==Passive/Active:==
- Passively motivated villains highlights the agency of the hero
	- React to what the heros do
- Actively motivated villains are more imposing
	- Pose more of a threat
==Good Guy villains:==
- Motivation is never as easy as ==good or evil==
- Good guy villains can be more relatable for the readers, give distinct tragic undertone to the story, and ease of making themes
==Tension==:
- Save the world stories are hard to sustain climactic tension
- Instead, derive tension from the fate of the characters or things involved

- Villains in video games command attention
- Seem insane and terrifying if in the real world
