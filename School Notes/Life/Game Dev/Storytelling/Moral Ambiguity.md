# Moral Ambiguity

taken from arcane analysis [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_xfBmcWPKI&ab_channel=schnee)

### 9 Methods
1. 

### 4 Rules
1. Expectations
	- Things are not what they seem
	- signal to audience how deep the story will be
		- if wacky characters suddenly break character, it would come off as a misinterpretation from the audience's end
		- but if characters are presented/introduced as a villain, but is actually not, after we learn more about them, its cool
	- setting
		- what is presented | contrasts with what is actually the case
		- ex. in arcane, piltover is a utopia, but the people are corrupt. In zaun, it seems like a dark filthy place, but people are close.
		- dont need to be strictly about morality tho
2. Unanswerable questions
	- Questions that humanity has struggled to answer
		- in arcane, its those like: "can we steal from the rich/corrupt?", "is law enforcement good?"
3. Backwards fate
	- ==Punished== for doing ==good==, ==rewarded== for doing ==bad==
	- these doesnt directly create moral ambiguity, but it does make audience feel ==moral outrage==, and makes us crave ==moral justice== 
4. Spectrum of morality
	- While SOME moral ambiguity is GREAT most times, if ==ALL THE CHARACTERS== are fucking complex, its exhausting.
	- Try introducing ==moral==, ==immoral==, ==amoral== characters to make the conflicts feel more explored
