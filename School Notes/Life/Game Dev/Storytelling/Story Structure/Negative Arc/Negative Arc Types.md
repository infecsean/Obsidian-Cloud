- A good negative arc will have the MC reveal interesting truths about the world around them and themselves. 
- Their arcs are rarely comfortable, we resonate with people who follow the lie and pay for it, because we ourselves repeat it so often.

### Disillusionment Arc
Character believes in lie --> Overcomes lie--> New truth is tragic
- in a way, this isnt a negative arc at all
- MC is just getting to understand the ==[[Want vs Need#Truth|truth]]== 
- MC is growing, but the truth is just ==FAX==, sad but tru fax

### The Fall Arc
MC believes in lie--> cling to lie --> rejects new truth --> believes in stronger/worse lie
- MC starts ==entrenched in the lie==, but unlike a positive arc where they overcome the lie and embrace the truth, MC will ==reject every chance== for embracing the ==truth==, falling deeper and deeper.
- ==Usually== drags ==others== with him
- Ends with insanity, oppressive morality, or death

### Corruption Arc
Character sees truth --> Rejects the truth --> Embraces Lie
- Start out in a world where the truth is embraced, but is lured away from the lie
- Similar to the truth in positive arc, the lie is just there
- Perhaps the most moving,
