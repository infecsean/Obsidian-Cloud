# Conflict in negative arcs
---
the negative sub-component of [[Want vs Need]]
[sauce](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/negative-character-arc-1/)

### The Lie
- oftentimes the lie is about something MC already possesses, but devalues
	- ex. already super rich, but fails to be grateful for his blessings
- There will be one thing that is ==objectively good== that he will take for granted.
- He will be willing to ==sacrifice== this thing (and its inherent truth) in order to ==pursue== the false promise of the ==Lie==

### The Want, Need, Ghost
- Basically the same as in positive arcs
- Except for how MC ==responds== to these
- They fall prey for the power over them, rather than overcoming it
