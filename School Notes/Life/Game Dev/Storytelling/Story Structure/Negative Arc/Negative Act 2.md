Act 2 is the heart, Act 1 is setting up the place from which MC falls, act 3 is showing the place to which he falls. Act 2 is where the falling happens, the place where you need to prove to the audience that the truth and lie have realism in character development.

Similarly to a positive arc, MC will get out of the Normal world to a new dilemma, be forced to confront the lie, and recognize its power over him.

MC will be increasingly enthralled by darkness.
The most major decisions will be made at the ==first plot point== and the ==midpoint==

### First Plot Point
- Since negative arcs are about a ==descend== into darkness, we have to start in a high place
- As such, the first plot point will usally be a positive one
- ==MOST IMPORTANTLY== foreshadow, you must
	- BUT be subtle

### First Half
- As in a positive arc, the first half should be MC ==REACTING== to the first plot point
- MC is delibrately moving towards their ==want==, however at a disadvantage
	- Usually a lack of knowledge about what hes facing against
- But MC ==may== not be fully prepared to ==do whatever it takes==

- in the ==disillusionment arc==, MC encounter difficulties pursuing the ==Lie==, even though he getting closer and closer to his ==want== while getting further from the ==need==
- in the ==fall arc==, MC will get ==full on lessons== in the truth, and will ==suffer== as a result of the ==lie==. He's not gonna get his ==want==, in fact, he will be ==punished== for trying. They will have moments where they rethink their devotion to the lie, but at the end of the day, they want their goal so badly to let it go
- in the ==corruption arc==, MC learns more and more about the lie. They recognize it as a path towards the ==want==. as their obsession increase, they begin more and more to embrace the ==lie== and reject the ==truth==

### Midpoint
- Up until this point, MC has been advancing ==towards== the ==lie==
- This point will have MC do something ==irreversable== or experience a ==clear revelation== that will have them go on a series of ==lie-based== actions in the ==second half=
- Simply put, MC need to be presented with the Truth, and an opportunity to follow it.

### Second Half
- MC will start to aggressively and actively ==pursue== the ==want==
- although MC will still get glimpses of the truth ==thru side characters==
- the ==truth== is no longer an obstacle
- Tragic premise indicate progression from ==bad to worse==
- Whatever the ==lie== is in the ==beginning==, it will now grow into its ==worst manifestation==
