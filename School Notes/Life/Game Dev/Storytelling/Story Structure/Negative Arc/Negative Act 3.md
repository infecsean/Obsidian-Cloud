# Negative arc act 3
---
[sauce](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/negative-character-arc-3/)

- If a positive arc is about redeeming self and saving others, negative arc is about destroying self and also others.
- All the decisions based on the ==lie== will turn out to be a BAD DECISION
- Unlike positive arc, negative arc MC will refuse to recognize their mistakes
- The power of negative arcs is not in their morals, but their recognizableness

### Third Plot Point
- A place that reeks of death
- Whatever the source is, his or other people's morality will be threatened

- Whereas in the other arcs, MC will be ready for the last fight. In a negative arc, MC will find themselves ==powerless== to face the horror. 
- They are lacking the weapon of the ==truth==, which is necessary to defeat the ==lie==.
- The only logical option now is to convince themselves the path theyve chosen is right

- The exception being the disillusionment arc, where MC will face the truth, but it will hit HARD

### Third Act
- After the third plot point, MC will rage against death and its power, rather than rising into a ressurection.
- Without the Truth, they cant cope with the tragedy.
- They will spend the first half of act 3 ==prior to climax== striking at the antagonist and reach for the ==want== at all costs.
- They have nothing to lose and no moral compass to guide them.

- Others ==may== try to reason with them, but they will be even less open to suggestions
- They might even turn on people, they simply cant afford to be talked out of it, the end is entirely outweighing the means it cost to achieve it.

### Climax
- Everything falls apart
- MC's last push to use the ==lie== to get the ==want==. Resulting in:
	- Outer success. MC get the want, but doesnt get the need. Often the climactic moment will include a glimpse of the truth, which MC realizes at the end when its all too late
	- Loses both. 
- In planning the climax, look back to the beginning of the book. The lie he struggled with should point to an obvious culmination at the climax, but times ten.

### Resolution
- Often short
- Leave little to no loose ends
- Dont usually inspire a desire to stick around the world

- In the event that MC dies, you will show the reaction of supporting characters. Since many of them will go along a disillusionment arc as a result of witnessing his fall.
- Show the effect of MC's actions, but show a hint of hope now that MC's dark influence is gone

- create a closing scene that drives home MC's ==final state==
- Whatever his fate is, it should be presented as the closing motif, contrasting how it began

- depressing endings are necessary, tell the negative arc boldly
