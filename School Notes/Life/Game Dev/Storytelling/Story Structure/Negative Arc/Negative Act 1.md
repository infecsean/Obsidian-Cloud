- Whenever the truth or the lie is on stage, the other ==MUST== also be on stage
- The lie gets ==precedence== over the truth
- Readers NEED to understand how the lie ==shaped== MC's world and their personal relationship with it

### Establishing the Stakes
- What is at stake if MC pursues the lie?
- What must he sacrifice if he choose truth?
- ==DONT== make the choices too black and white
