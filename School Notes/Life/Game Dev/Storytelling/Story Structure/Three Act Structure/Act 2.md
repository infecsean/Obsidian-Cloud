# Act 2
---
The bulk of the story, filling about ==half== of the runtime.
Consists of a series of ==tests and trials== to test mc and further develop ==plots and subplots==

Act 2 need to ==escalate== plot conflict, moments of ==growth and failure==, develop story through ==cast, themes, subplots, and worldbuilding==. 

### Act 2.0 and Act 2.5
For more structure i guess

Act 2.0
- Period of ==reaction== driven by decisions made at the [[Life/Game Dev/Storytelling/Story Structure/Three Act Structure/Act 1#First Plot Point sauce https thenovelsmithy com story-structure-3-first-plot-point|first pinch point]]
- MC is ==pushed forward== by the plot, being punished for lack of skills.
- They are ==learning== tho
Act 2.5
- Hard work pays off, through all the knowledge gained in 2.0
- Period of ==action==, actively working towards a ==solution== to the problems

### First Pinch Point ([sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-4-act-2/))
- Reminder or introduction of the ==antagonist== and ==stakes== of the story
- It ==SHOWS== why the conflict is real and why the ==antagonist== is powerful
- Often ==foreshadows== a future attack
- CAN have the MC not be involved in it
	- Meant for the audience, while MC stays ignorant
- If MC IS involved, remember that they are still unprepared to deal with it, as they are in a period of ==reaction==. As such, they should be caught off guard, with the antagonist in ==full control== of the scene
- Important for the ==ANTAGONIST== to shine

Placement
- Should be between the start of act 2 and the midpoint
- try not to get distracted from the ==CORE conflict== of the story
- It should come up ==organically== like the hook
- Keeps the plot progressing while also exploring potential subplots

official goals
-   This is your chance to explore your cast, world, and plot—so take advantage of it!
-   Spend some time developing your protagonist’s arc.
-   Introduce readers to the other members of your cast.
-   Challenge your protagonist as they grow their skills and knowledge
-   Create a turning point that will shift your protagonist from reaction to action
-   Prepare for the dark moment that begins Act 3


### Midpoint ([sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-5-the-midpoint/))
- Most importantly, it is a turning point. A new discovery, info, event, triumph.
- A time for reflection and growth, MC is now in a different world with differet ppl
- MC can look back and no longer feel unsure if leaving was a good idea
- Turning point of the story, where MC gets the final piece to face the challenge
- MC moves from a period of ==reaction== to ==action==, by ==overcoming== a great challenge
	- This challenge should be the cumilation of all the trials before this point
	- it ==forces== MC to demonstrate their new skills
- Overcoming the challenge, they prove to themsleves and others that they are ready
- They can now fully engage with the conflict

Protagonist
- Offers a solution to MC's [[Want vs Need|wants]], without having to go through the process of addressing the [[Want vs Need|need]].
>it's easier to ignore the inner struggle, after all.
- This ==DOESNT== mean they havent grown from act 2.0
- Likely start to uncover the truth and treatment for the ==inner struggle==.
	- likely to resist the truth and circle around the inner struggle

Pacing
- weak turning points stunt plot and character development, and sets up a weak ==third plot point== and ==climax==
- weak midpoint may have you cram necessary details into act 2.5, making the story feel ==rushed==
	- These rushed details won't have breathing room or time for reflection, feeling less impactful on the climax
- Try to keep it as close to the 50% mark
> too important to be overlooked!

### Second Pinch Point ([sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-6-third-plot-point/))
- Much like the [[Act 2#First Pinch Point sauce https thenovelsmithy com story-structure-4-act-2|first pinch point]], it reminds the audience of the antagonist's power
	- However, MC is much more likely to be involved in it
	- because the first is meant for the audience and leave MC ignorant, the second one need to be the MC, especially after the success at the midpoint, where both the audience and MC might forget the stakes
- It anchors the growth of MC in Act 2, and can be used for foreshadowing act 3
- Keep the conflict ==real== and ==pressing== so the ==downfall== in [[Act 3]] will feel more real
- It strengthens the story going into act 3, and so it should mirror the placement of the first pinch point - ==halfway== across the midpoint and the third plot point
- most important of all, let it happen ==organically==, after a moment of hubris of MC

### Third Plot Point ([sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-6-third-plot-point/))
- This, along with the first plot point and midpoint, forms the ==primary narrative== and ==emotional arcs== of the story. the third one being the ==darkest moment==
- The skills will prove to be ==insufficient== and the power of the antagonist will force MC to change tactics
- MC will realize the complexity of the conflict, often a while after the audience does, creating a sense of ==irony==
- Most importantly, it affects MC the most.
- Up til this point, MC has been affected by the conflict between the [[Want vs Need|want and the need]]
	- And the arc ==CANNOT== be completed without overcoming the inner struggle

Character arc
- It forces MC to confront and reflect on the need throughout [[Act 3]], directly impact their success at the climax
- The most important thing is to ==target== their ==want== and their ==inner struggle==
	- The want can be taken away, forcing them to work even harder to achieve it
	- The inner struggle would mostly target the deepest flaws and insecurities to make them feel truely defeated

Placement
- Less flexible
- about 75% mark
- For act 2 to transition smoothly into act 3, leaving plenty of time to naturally reach the conclusion at the climax
- pace is ramping up
