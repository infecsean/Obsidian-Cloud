# Act 1
---
Act 1 has to create an impression from the audience, setup the story's purpose, and establish the ==external== and ==internal== conflicts

Remember: Remove everything that is not necessary to the story

==Dramatic Question==: 
- The fundamental question answered by the [[Act 3#Climax|Climax]]
- another way to think is that the audience wants to find the answer to the question . 
- It creates ==suspense==. 
- The reader will side with main character hoping he achieve what he wants
- It ==sets up== audience's ==expectations== and invest into the story

### Hook ([sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-1-act-1-the-hook/))
- Hooks the audience with interesting story bread crumbs to follow deeper
- You frame is as a ==question== BUT, it's ==NOT== the dramatic question, instead it guides the player towards it to feel more natural
- The best place is to feel natural (==BUT DONT DRAG TOO FAR INTO STORY==)
- Dramatic question should follow this question not long after
- also ==DONT== bait the audience's expectations (misleading the true nature of the story)

offical notes
-   Hook your readers and get them interested in your story’s world.
-   Establish your setting and begin worldbuilding.
-   Set up your plot and any important plot elements you’ll need later on.
-   Begin [your protagonist’s character arc](https://www.thenovelsmithy.com/positive-negative-character-arcs/) by introducing their inner struggle.
-   Above all, introduce your reader to the Dramatic Question of your story.

### Inciting Event ([sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-2-inciting-event/))
- These two are the beginning of the story's plot
- Sparks the match, the point of no return
- Trigger the event that will set the plot in motion
- ==ONLY PLOT FOCUSED==, not concerned with character's involvement in plot
- the tricky part is that it can happen as early as the [[Act 1#Hook sauce https thenovelsmithy com story-structure-1-act-1-the-hook|hook]] or as late as the [[Act 1#First Plot Point|first plot point]]
- It solidifies the audience's expectations as to what really is going on here
- doing it early won't hurt

- if the inciting event takes place before the novel, it can be ==bad==
	- makes conflict feel removed
	- hard to make mc involved in it
- hence, best to be more immediate

### Key Event ([sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-2-inciting-event/))
- These two are the beginning of the story's plot
- Key event is focused on the mc
- Where plot and protagonist meet and affect each other
- ==AFTER== the inciting event

### First Plot Point ([sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-3-first-plot-point/))
- The pivotal moment where the protagonist begins their journey thru an important decision they make
>"Could be the decision to set out on an adventure, sacrifice themselves for loved ones, run away, or speak up against the family"
- Should occur at 25% of the story, important cus it marks the point for the mc and plot
- MC should make a decision, almost always related to the key event.
- This is like accepting the "call to adventure", even if they are somewhat ==forced to do so==
- MC becomes an active player in the story
- MC is fully engaged in the story

secondary role
- without this decision, MC would never take the steps to ==overcome their inner struggles== and completing the arc. So, the first plot point should relate to MC's ==inner struggle==
- Their decision here will grow organically out of the desire to overcome the struggles

placement
- ==CRITICAL== for pacing to work out
- 20%-25% of the story
- occur at the ==VERY END== of Act 1
- too early, they wont have time to get invested. too late, they will feel like the story is slow and boring
