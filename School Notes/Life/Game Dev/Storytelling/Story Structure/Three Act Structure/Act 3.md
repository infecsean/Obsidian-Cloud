### Act 3
---
[sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-7-act-3/)
Final confrontation between the MC and the bad guy
Meant to provide the audience with closure for the journey together
All of the past achievements should become relevant here

The opening of act 3 give MC time to reflect and the last moment of growth

Climax will increase ==pace== and ==tension== for MC until the climactic moment
Once MC wins, we will get a sense of what life will be after conflict is over

Plot:
- all the developments should come together, equiping MC for success, to a ==logical conclusion==, imply a living and breathing world long after the story

Characters:
- Marks the end of the arc
	- recognize their ==truth==
	- overcome ==inner struggle==
	- fulfill ==need==
that is, if it is a standard positive character arc.

- Backing MC into a corner, intense pressure culminates, end with their success/failure
- Resolution provides rest after this intense thing
- often MC returns home a changed person. 
- gives a sense of catharsis

### Climax
- deliver all you promised at the [[Act 1#Hook sauce https thenovelsmithy com story-structure-1-act-1-the-hook|hook]], final confrontation between MC and bad guy

Plot
- a point of no return, much like the [[Act 1#First Plot Point sauce https thenovelsmithy com story-structure-3-first-plot-point|first plot point]] is the point of no return for the start of the journey, climax is the point of no return for the end of the journey
- conflict will reach an end (whether good or bad)
- This ==NEEDS== to be done by MC however, it's their choice after all, a judgement of their own conscious, ==morals==, decisions.
- this climax ==CANNOT== just be bad luck.

character
- tying the climax to their ==conscious== choice fulfills its role as the cumilation of the arc
- Here, MC will need to ==confront the truth== and ==address the need==
- the design of the third plot point and the climax ==NEED== to TRAP THEM so that they have little choice but to ==CONFRONT== it

Placement
- Climax is a bit tricky, since resolution follows it, and only need to last 1-2 scenes
- So if there are any subplots needed to be resolved, resolve them or nearly resolve them before the climax so they can be slightly mentioned at the resolution
- should take up most of act 3
- characters pace should increase as they come together

#### Climactic moment
- nested inside of the climax
- the decisive moment that resolves the conflict between MC and the antagonist
- the moment the climax has been setting up for
- the moment where the ==dramatic question== is answered
- the climactic moment is the ==deciding event==, while the climax is about ==setting the stage==
- begins the transition from ==conflict to resolution==
- drive the story to its logical conclusion, stick with the ==themes== and ==symbolism== 

MC
- logical conclusion of the ==arc==
- either accept the truth or abandon it, will end the arc
- it could be a dramatic speech, a realization, a choice
- whatever it is, they must embrace the truth and overcome the ==inner struggle==

two plot points
- since the climax is the setup for the climactic moment, it gives other characters time to complete their arc, all while setting the stage for said moment
- it separates the setup mode and the finale
- the character/s figure out what this victory/failure will mean to their lives

### Resolution ([sauce](https://thenovelsmithy.com/story-structure-9-the-resolution/))
- Catharsis - inner purification
- The deep, emotional satisfaction at the end of a good story

Plot
- tie off ==loose ends==
	- MC returns home and ride off into the sunset
	- ultimate fate of the antagonist (if they survived)
	- finish subplots or side characters
- show how characters end their journey and what comes next as result of their success/failure
- imply a life beyond them, a living world that lives on long after the character
- ==DONT== introduce questions about the journey you just completed, but a new journey ==ahead==
- 1-2 scenes

characters
- need to show how much each character has grown from the journey
- ties ==directly== into their arc, usually into themes and symbols as well
- foil scenes
	- antagonists are mirrors of the protagonist
	- mirror a scene where MC cant face some challenge, at the end, it would be that MC can face the challenge easily, showing how much theyve grown
	- dont need to be on the nose
- ==NOT THE SAME FOR NEGATIVE ARCS==, those have very little resolutionn

sequels
