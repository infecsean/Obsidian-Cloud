# Scene Structure

Taken from [this](https://thenovelsmithy.com/scene-structure-basics/)

**Action**
-   Goal: Your character is pursuing a goal.
-   Conflict: They face conflict while trying to reach that goal.
-   Outcome: Thereâ€™s an outcome, either positive or negative.

**Reaction**
-   Reaction: Your character reacts to the previous outcome.
-   Reflection: They reflect on their options going forward.
-   Decision: They make a decision, forming a new goal and beginning the cycle again.

### Seeing what's what
- Study each scene
- Identify the goal, conflict, outcome, reaction, reflection, and decision.

### Starting and ending with a goal
- marking MC's goals will help identify weak components
- MC needs to face trials and change as a result
- as MC tries to hold on to their ==inner struggle==, punish them with a negative outcome
- as MC pursues flawed goals, punish them. as they pursue the truth, give them positive outcomes
- ==errors== can be identified if you find that there is ==little change== between the goals, or an ==illogical jump== between goals

### Thinking of scenes as questions
Questions outlines the goal of the scene, and the answer tells you the outcome.

### Be strict with yourself
- The scenes NEED to fit in the theme and the larger plot of the story
- all elements must have a purpose
- ==UNLESS ITS A TRANSITION==, which you should use sparingly
