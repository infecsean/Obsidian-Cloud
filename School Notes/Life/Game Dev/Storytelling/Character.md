### CHARACTERS ARE FLAWED

- What wound the character has
- How they are going to be healing it

- Create different characters with mostly the same traits, but a little make-or-break property to show what might potentially happen should you go down the same path
	- Characters that have ideologies that revolves around others will be weaker since they are fighting for others
- Characters need
	- Want is what a character need to proactively achieve
	- Need is what a character can reactively realize
	- Lie: A lie they've been believing their whole life
	- Ghost: often a traumatic experience that makes them believe in the lie. In the form of the backstory
- Often in the start, the character will be reactive, blinded by lie and refuse to call.
- eventually the lie will be a punishment and force them to accept the truth
- Then, midpoint: When character turns from reactive to proactive

### Conflict
- Drama is created by the status quo
	- If the status quo is changed, drama is created
	- that is, if you creating a horror movie
- Drama in arcane is created by the status quo not changing
	- people who are willing to prevent the status quo from changing - Sevika

### For companions

Companions people care about
- Have to have ==Desires== and ==Flaws==
	- in fiction, flaws work best when ==common== and ==forgivable==
	- personality flaws (not necessarily) affect the main character (ex. recklessness)
	- characters that have made the same stupid mistakes you have
- A balanced companion that ==doesnt get in the player's way== and ==not invulnerable==
	- A companion that the player relies on can sometimes be good as it ==highlights== (hah) the importance of them
	- The latter is better than the former
	- add human elements (==creates a sense that they can act independently of you==)

### Names

- A pallette
- Hard sounds: Harder character
- Soft sounds: Softer character
- Villains: Ends with s, multiple syllables
- DONT DO: names that describe who the character is
