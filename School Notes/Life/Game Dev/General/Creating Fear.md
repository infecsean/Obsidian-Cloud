### What invokes fear?
**SATO**:Â I do not think human would feel fear by seeing monster with fangs, horns and such 
typical scary visual language. I think there are two main factors that evoke fear: first, to see something beyond their understanding; second, to see concealed their true-self.

I think same rule applies no matter what kind of creatures, environment you use. The concept seem enough reflected in the world of SILENT HILL.
