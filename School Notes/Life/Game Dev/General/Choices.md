### What are invisible choices?
- Choices that arent stated explicitly
	- Maybe you are told to do something, but you can actually do something else

### Why would we want that?
- ==Ambiguous Options==: The game can hide alternative options
	- Allows smart players to think about the situations and think about tools at their disposal
	- Make players feel smart
	- make game feel organic and believable
- ==Unequal Options==: The player has to put in effort to get the better outcome.
	- Could also be not a choice: ex. a test of skill
	- Make the player feel more complicit and themselves are actually doing it
- ==Fine Grain Options==: When a game collects a ton of invisible choices, has a lot of info
	- Can lead to a game feeling more personalized (ex. Shadow of War)
	- The game can comment on little details
- ==Suprising Outcomes==: Since it is hard to surprise players, this way is easier.
	- Collect information of player's playstyle or stuff to then comment on it
	- A player saving a guy (thinking they would run away), but he comes back to help you

### Of course, there are challenges
- Cant account for all actions
- If gameplay restricts information collection, it can be hard (say, if players can only shoot)
- Players might not even know they can do something
	- May need to teach players that they have other options
		- Disobeying commands (stanley parabola)
