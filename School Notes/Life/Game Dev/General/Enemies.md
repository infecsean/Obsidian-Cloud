# Making Enemies
---
These rules are suggested by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqaTqI1XSWw).
1. Difficulty: Reflect the difficulty that it is supposed to be, fun, aggressive.
```ad-example
title: Example
In the beginning of a game, introduce easier enemies, to get the player to know the game mechanics and develop muscle memory.
```
2. Specific: Be specific, more variety, not like COD many gun pew pew variety, but like enemy variety that leads to different player approach
3. Personality: Appearance, how it interacts with the player, 
```ad-example
Cowardly enemies: Run away whenever they see you
Drives the player to give it a chase
```
```ad-example
title: Example 2
Snipers: usually have laser lines to indicate that they r fucking snipers
Forces the player to play stategically to avoid getting sniped
```
4. Synergistic: Change behaviour that create different interactions and strats
```ad-example
in halo, there are these smol dudes that run away when they see you, but are fucking chads when they are with their dad.
This forces the player to choose how they approach enemies, kill the dad.
```
```ad-tip
title: Utility
Enemies doesnt always have to be killed, they can be utilized, in fun ways, you can jump on enemies to get a boost or something.
```

At the end of the day, everything is about the player, how they interact, and the attachment
