2. Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.  

Things to consider: What does creativity mean to you? Do you have a creative skill that is important to you? What have you been able to do with that skill? If you used creativity to solve a problem, what was your solution? What are the steps you took to solve the problem?

How does your creativity influence your decisions inside or outside the classroom? Does your creativity relate to your major or a future career?


I like things that carry a lot of emotional value. As a student, I often spend a lot of time watching tutorials online on how to make toys; back when school was still about making friends, I like to bring toys that I made to school and share it with my friends. I didn't remember them being impressed, but the joy it brought me to bring a small change to someone else's life, I can never forget. As I grew older, I found that something was holding me back, my toys only kept me company as more of them started to gather dust somewhere in a box. At some point I must stop, they stopped bringing me joy, and I realized that all it did was waste my time; I tried to focus on my academics instead. During that time, I felt like something was missing. Although nothing was wrong, I didn't feel comfortable sitting in a chair and listening to someone talk for 8 hours, I found it much more enjoyable spacing out or sketching a mustache on a historical figure in my textbook. One day in the first year of high school, I was chatting with my friend when the subject of making video games came up, he was looking for a team of people with coding skills or art skills. I had neither, but since nobody at that age had any skill at that age, I was accepted. At first, I was assigned the task of learning how to code, but as others learned coding, they became interested in coding itself. However, this opportunity was all I needed, and although I didn't immediately recognize it, it changed my life forever, as it opened up an entire world of interests that I can explore and try out. I did exactly that, trying everything from 3d modeling, animating, to video editing. At one point I found myself back to watching tutorials again, only this time, it was different; I realized that my creativity was never holding me back, but rather my technical skills. The fire in me that had stopped burning for a long time was reignited, as I picked up more and more skills.
  

3. What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?  

Things to consider: If there’s a talent or skill that you’re proud of, this is the time to share it. You don’t necessarily have to be recognized or have received awards for your talent (although if you did and you want to talk about it, feel free to do so). Why is this talent or skill meaningful to you?

Does the talent come naturally or have you worked hard to develop this skill or talent? Does your talent or skill allow you opportunities in or outside the classroom? If so, what are they and how do they fit into your schedule?




4. Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.

Things to consider: An educational opportunity can be anything that has added value to your educational experience and better prepared you for college. For example, participation in an honors or academic enrichment program, or enrollment in an academy that’s geared toward an occupation or a major, or taking advanced courses that interest you — just to name a few. 

If you choose to write about educational barriers you’ve faced, how did you overcome or strive to overcome them? What personal characteristics or skills did you call on to overcome this challenge? How did overcoming this barrier help shape who you are today?

  

These two bullet points are the same essay, I bulleted them because of structure.

-   The best decision I’ve ever made was agreeing to transfer to the international department of my school. For what felt like the slippery slope that was my life until middle school, I failed at every subject except english. I survived under the immense pressure of traditional education through my friends, they were all I had, and they kept me happy. Outside of school, I had little time to myself due to the workload, but when I did, I played video games; they were my escape from life, from everything else, a limitless world built upon people’s imagination. I was emotionally attached to games, “addicted” as people say, I wanted to be a part of it, but it was a dream too far-fetched. 
    
-   My family did everything to help me: tutors, cram school, medication, restricting my play time, nothing worked, and it was clear that I was doomed. That was until my mother proposed to transfer me into the international department during the last year of middle school; Seeing that nothing was working, I hesitantly accepted, and briefly regretted it. Every day during lunch time, I would walk halfway across the school campus and eat with my old friends. The new system was taught in English, rather than Chinese in the traditional system. I felt more at home, but still socially anxious. The differences were beyond noticeable, there was a clear focus on our future, the balance of academic difficulty allowed me to stay motivated to get good grades, but most importantly, I met some great people, many of whom I can just see the ambition inside of them. For the first time, I felt like my life was going somewhere, and I was right. I was eventually introduced to coding, which I thought was useless at the time, but with all the extra time I had, I went on to learn 3D modeling, animation, digital painting, music composition, video editing, all of which I’ve used throughout the years of highschool, but most importantly, my seemingly unachievable dream of becoming a game developer now seem impossible, but I am ambitious.(?)(349 words yay)好喔你很棒 加油
    

  

5. Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?

Things to consider: A challenge could be personal, or something you have faced in your community or school. Why was the challenge significant to you? This is a good opportunity to talk about any obstacles you’ve faced and what you’ve learned from the experience. Did you have support from someone else or did you handle it alone?

If you’re currently working your way through a challenge, what are you doing now, and does that affect different aspects of your life? For example, ask yourself, “How has my life changed at home, at my school, with my friends or with my family?”

  

8. Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?

Things to consider:  If there’s anything you want us to know about you, but didn’t find a question or place in the application to tell us, now’s your chance. What have you not shared with us that will highlight a skill, talent, challenge or opportunity that you think will help us know you better?

From your point of view, what do you feel makes you an excellent choice for UC? Don’t be afraid to brag a little.
