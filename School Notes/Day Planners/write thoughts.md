###### To finish environments, i would need
if im gonna finish environment smoothly, i would need to finish:
- Learning environment design
- building design
- artstyle direction
- hardops
- painting skyboxes
- painting concrete and grass and shit
- concept art

so i would need to finish:
- learning concept art
- learning environment design
- finish map of town, school, houses, mind, home

###### Stuff about how my approach from reference to concept art to finished model
I want borderlands art style stuff -> get reference art
how to make stuff from reference art? no model from reference because plagarism
make own concept art from references -> make model from concept art
take picture of model -> try to draw the finished look on model
refine and apply texture on model

###### Prototyping process
- Stablize systems
	- Movement
	- Dialogue
	- Emotions
	- Cutscene & Transitioning
	- Interaction (fpe kit but replace movement)
	- Settings, UI, HUD
		- Menu anti-tutorial hint feature
		-  
- Make floor plan and stuff
- Block out the stuff in unity to test movement and the rest of the system
- Enter making process i guess
	- eg. making all the 3d models, fmod shit, audio, characters

thats the writing process lol

###### Problems im goin thru
- Is my acccountability plan working out
	- my plan so far: achieved, but i dont feel enough stress over me
	- xNode isnt done, if i had spent more time on it, i wouldve finished a while ago
	- hammo stuff isnt easy to interpret i assume, so this week will have to be squeezed to finish both the xnode system and the hammo movement AND cs club movement will have to be done tomorrow
	- SAT and college stuff and math is not even touched, been playing too much horizon

###### Movemint
