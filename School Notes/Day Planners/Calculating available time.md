# Calculations
---

Weekdays: 8pm ~ 11pm = 3 hours

3 hours everyday for 5 days - 1 hour class = ==14 hours==

Weekends: 12pm ~ 12pm - 3 hours meal time = 9 hours

9 hours for 2 days = ==18 hours== + any bonus hours from waking the fuck up

1 Week = ==32 hours==

5 Weeks = ==160 hours==

32 hours of study + play + work time a week

==Assuming== no fucking procrastination and sleeping on time
In other words, assuming full productivity for all 160 hours
I will have 160 hours to work with. ==AT HOME==.

## Chunky things I can predict probably maybe

1. Econ study

Probably will take like 10 hours studying 20 hours past papers

2. Physics study

Taking 10 hours studying 20 hours past papers

3. Math study

4. Computer Science study
