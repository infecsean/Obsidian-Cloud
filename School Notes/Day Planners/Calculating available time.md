# Calculations
---

Weekdays: 8pm ~ 11pm = 3 hours

3 hours everyday for 5 days - 1 hour class = ==14 hours==

Weekends: 12pm ~ 12pm - 3 hours meal time = 9 hours

9 hours for 2 days = ==18 hours== + any bonus hours from waking the fuck up

1 Week = ==32 hours==

4 Weeks = ==128 hours==

32 hours of study + play + work time a week

==Assuming== no fucking procrastination and sleeping on time
In other words, assuming full productivity for all 160 hours
I will have 128 hours to work with. ==AT HOME==.

## Chunky things I can predict probably maybe

1. Econ study

Probably will take like 10 hours studying 20 hours past papers

2. Physics study

Taking 10 hours studying 20 hours past papers

3. Math study

LIke 10 hours reviewing 20 hours past papers hopefully

4. Computer Science study

like 5 hours reviewing 15 hours past papers

Econ = 30 hr
Physics = 30 hr
Math = 30 hr
CS = 20 hr

Without English/Chinese, study time is fucking 110 hours

### Ways I can distribute the time
1. All at once

Meaning: Review all/many subjects a week
Pro: Consistent and school-like memorizing
Con: Tiring and might be more complicated schedule-wise

2. One at a time

Meaning: Review one subject a time, move on to next when finished
Pro: Easy and not so much juggling and worrying about other subjects
Con: Easy to get overwhelmed or tired of the subject, leading to diminishing returns

### Conclusion
For now I will do one at a time lmao
Starting with either econ/physics
But i also wanna do fucking math

Ok new plan do econ/physics but do math consistently
Boom easy plan, now lets look at execution

==Backup plan==: If I get tired or just burnt out from econ then just switch to physics

ok this is no conclusion

### Present

29 hrs left to lose

hypothetically i will finish econ, physics, and cs in this week, realistically, no
