# New EE I guess

Reasoning: Since Ontogenetic/Teleological algorithms is too broad to simply compare as two "types". At least that's how Im not confident in it. I saw some examples with topics comparing djikstra's algorithm and A* algorithm. 

Things i found from [this paper](https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/256132/256132.pdf)
- How hard is the algorithm to implement?
- How many levels of abstraction does it use? 
- How easy is it to change or adjust it into something specific? 
- How difficult or easy is to use? For whom?
- How easy is it to mix with other algorithms?
- How handmade does it feel? I.e, is it easy to detect that a human did not build a specific level?
- How much variation does it allow? Can one easily see patterns?
- How well does it scale up or down?
And this from this [paper](https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:m0455c71t/fulltext.pdf)

### Algorithms to consider:
1. Wave Function Collapse Algorithm
- [Explained](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/)
- [Explained 2](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2020/04/13/wave-function-collapse-explained/)

Pros:
- Very nice well know well documented algorithm
Cons:
- Hard
- Uses tile based generation instead of full on shitshow

2. Agent Based Algorithm
	- [Terrain Generation](https://ianparberry.com/research/terrain/)
	- Data Structure: Linear
	
	Pros:
	- Good i guess
	Cons:
	- HARD ASF

3. Cellular Automation
- [Level Generation](https://www.raywenderlich.com/2425-procedural-level-generation-in-games-using-a-cellular-automaton-part-1)
- Data Structure: Random



4. Binary Space Partioning | Binary Space Tree
- [Dungeon Generator|Medium](https://medium.com/@guribemontero/dungeon-generation-using-binary-space-trees-47d4a668e2d0)
- Data Structure: Tree
