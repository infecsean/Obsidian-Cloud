Reasoning: Since Ontogenetic/Teleological algorithms is too broad to simply compare as two "types". At least that's how Im not confident in it. I saw some examples with topics comparing djikstra's algorithm and A* algorithm. 

Algorithms to consider:
1. Wave Function Collapse Algorithm
- [Explained](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/)



2. Agent Based Algorithm
- [Terrain Generation](https://ianparberry.com/research/terrain/)



3. Cellular Automata
- [Level Generation](https://www.raywenderlich.com/2425-procedural-level-generation-in-games-using-a-cellular-automaton-part-1)



4. Space Partioning | Binary Space Tree
- [Dungeon Generator|Medium](https://medium.com/@guribemontero/dungeon-generation-using-binary-space-trees-47d4a668e2d0)
