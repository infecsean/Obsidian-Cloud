Problems
- Ontogenetic VS Teleological
	- Can I evaluate by comparing the amount of lines of code?
		- Yes. The more code you write, the more difficult it should be.
		- No. More lines of code COULD relate to algorithmic difficulty, but not always. Could be just a lot of variables.

On the argument of simulating the forming process verses just simply generating it as it appears on the surface, ther are some problems.

1. How to evaluate efficiency?
It doesn't make sense to evaluate it by dividing criteria by the time spent doing it.
The time spent isn't reliable enough to be considered a factor in efficiency.

2. Evaluate by time complexity?
Big O notation and stuff

3. Can't reliably compare a simplex noise generated map and a heavily user-implemented parameter-rich map.
I can't think of a fucking way to fix this

4. Major flaws in experiment design
By my definition in the introduction, teleological algorithms simulate the process of which nature generates its terrain. BY DEFINITION, I would have to simulate all this shit. Its time for a new plan.
