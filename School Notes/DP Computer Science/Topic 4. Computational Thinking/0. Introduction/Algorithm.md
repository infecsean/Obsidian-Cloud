### What the FUCK is an algorithm
- A series of ==unambiguous== instructions designed to solve a problem in a finite number of steps
- Properties:
	- Finiteness: Finite number of steps
	- Definiteness: Each step must be precisely defined, unambiguously
	- Input: Quantities given before the algorithm begins
	- Output: Quantities which have some sort of relations with the input
	- Effectiveness: Must be basic enuff so that IN THEORY it can be written by a human
- The simpler the problem, the simpler the algorithm.
- There can also be many approaches to a problem![[approaches to a problem.png|600]]
- Ways of expressing an algorithm:
	- Simple english - ambiguous, not used often
	- [[Flow charts]] - avoids ambiguity
	- [[Pseudocode]] - placeholder code
	- Programming language - can describe algorithms, create programs, control machinery
