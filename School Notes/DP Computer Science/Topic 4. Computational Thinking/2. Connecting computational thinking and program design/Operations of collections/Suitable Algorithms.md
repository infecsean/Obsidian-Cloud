- Minimizing use of CPU and Memory is important

### Correctness
- The extent to which the algorithm:
	- satisfies the specification
	- free from faults
	- fulfills all objectives set

### Reliability
- Capability of the program to maintain predefined level of performance
- performs all functions under stated conditions
- long mean time between failures

### Flexibility
- Effort required to modify the algorithm for other purposes
