# Selection Sort
---
Simple and inefficient sorting algorithm
- Divides input array into two sub-arrays
- First array contain sorted elements, second array contain unsorted elements and occupies the rest of the array
- At beginning, sorted array is empty, unsorted array is the entire array
- Program searches for the largest/smallest element and put it in sorted array
- Algorithm then moves the first sub-array borders one element right
