### Input and output in a solution
- Input is something that is put into a program
- Output is something that is produced by the program after a process
	- Ex. given by book: [[Velocity and Speed|Physics]], If we want our program to return the velocity (v) and we have the displacement and time (s & t). ![[calculation of velocity.png]]

### Pre-planning
- Pre-planning: Planning something in advance
- Pre-fetching: Getting data or instructions from memory/cache before they are actually needed. This is used to ==save time== and ==improve efficiency==
- Software libraries: Common use of pre-planning, it uses existing code or stuff ready for future use.
- Gantt chart: A kind of bar chart named after Henry Chart #nooneasked. Used for project schedule and project management.

### Pre-conditions
- In large procedures, there are sub-procedures.
- Pre-conditions indicate the conditions that allow the sub-procedures to be called
- Post-conditions indicate what will be the conditions after the task is complete
- ==note== that you need to be able to identify pre/post-conditions in a situation

 ### Exceptions
 - Exceptions are events that disrupt the flow of a program's anticipated execution
 - They happen during the execution of a program and can be handled with specific mechanisms
