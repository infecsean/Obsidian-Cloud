### The appropriate method
When there is a problem, a method should be ==identified==.
The method should reduce the solution into simple ==steps==.
The steps should be followed in a ==specific order== to get the desired output.

### Order of activities
Order matters
If you wanna get a job, you will need to have past experiences of a job
If you wanna have a baby, you will need a wife (more often than not)

### Subprocedures
Subprocedures are important when it comes to solving ==complex problems==.
Breaking down a problem so that each small method can tackle specific problems.
