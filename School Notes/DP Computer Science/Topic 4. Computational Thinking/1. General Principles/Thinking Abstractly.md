# Thinking abstractly ![[thonk gif.gif|60]]
---
### The concept of abstract thinking
- Reflecting on ideas, events, attributes, everything in general without discussing unnecessary details
- Abstraction is used in computer programming
	- CPU and RAMs, although known to be fundamental components, they are abstractions
	- They are abstractions of gates and integrated circuits

### Object oriented programming (OOP)
- Uses abstraction
- On the concept that everyday tasks can be considered as entities (objects or events)
- Uses programming objects that describe behavior (methods) and data (properties)
- Makes complex programs easier to develop, facilitating maintainence
- An evolution of *procedural (Structural) programming*, which uses ==procedures== that can ==interact== and ==exchange data== as building blocks of programs.
- ==Collections==: Collections are data structures that have data and predefined methods that operates on the data

### Modeling and Simulation
- When a system is understood enough, scientists will describe it using mathematical languages.
- Mathematical modeling is a layer of abstraction

### Abstraction IRL
- ==Thematic maps== are abstractions of reality. It shows the spacial distribution and emphasizes on a specific theme (say, income level)
- ==Topographic maps== are abstractions of selected physical features of the 3D world reduced to 2D
- ==Political maps== are abstractions of political territory, it shows boundaries and cities of countries.

These allow many abstractions to occur, and the themes guide others and facilitate study and understanding.
