# Thinking Concurrently ![[thonk gif.gif|60]]
---
### Concurrent implementation
- Concurrent means something that happens at the same time as something else
- Multitasking is a good example: Driving and reading can happen concurrently, driving and walking can not happen concurrently
- In CS, concurrent processing means executing many instructions at the same time by many processors to achieve best performance

### Concurrent processing
- IRL, concurrent processing is used in building houses, and everyday stuff that we do simultaniously
- It requires better planning and coordination of resources
