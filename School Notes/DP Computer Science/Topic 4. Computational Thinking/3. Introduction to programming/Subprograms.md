# Sub-programs
---
### What is a sub-program
- A unit that contains a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task
- ==Code Reuse== is useful for speeding up the process
	- Authors of new programs can use existing software libraries, which contains sub programs

### Advantages of a sub-program
- Break complex problems down into simpler problems
- Distribute large programming problems among programmers
- Enable code reuse across programs
- Facilitate abstraction by hiding unecessary details
- Improve maintainability and tracability
- Reducing code duplication in the same program

### Advantages of collections
- Predefined algorithms that programmers can immediately use
- Performance is increased by data management capabilities
- Software reuse facilitated since it is based on a common language and interface
