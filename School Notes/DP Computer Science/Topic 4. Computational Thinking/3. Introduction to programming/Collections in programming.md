- ==Allow== duplicate elements, ==allow== ordered and unordered elements
- Some important operations: ==add, remove==
- Elements are typically ==all of the same type== and represents an ==entity==
- Not to be confused with ==[[Arrays of Objects|arrays]]==, since they can only contain a fixed amount of values
