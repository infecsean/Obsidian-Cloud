# Variables, Constants, Operators, Objects
---
### Variables
- Used to store data of program
- Value ==can be changed== during execution
- Has a name(identifier) and type
- Name of the variable shouldnt clash with reserved keywords and literals of the language
- type could be Ex. integer, double, string
- A variable most of the time can only store data elements of a particular type

### Constants
- Represents things and quantities that ==dont change==
- ==Non modifiable variables==, non fungible tokens even ![[lmao emoji.png|30]]
- ==Cant be changed== during execution

### Operators
- Used to manipulate operands
- Ex. in 3 + 2, + is the operator and 3 & 2 are operands
- ==Operands== can be variables, literals, booleans, numerical values, text
- ==Operators== can be arithmetic, relational, logical

### Objects
- Comprised of ==data== and ==action== 
- ==Actions== refer to operations that can be performed by the object
- Object data may include a number of ==data members==, actions may also be refered to as ==methods==
- Data members are used to store current state of an object and methods are used to ==change or access== those data members
