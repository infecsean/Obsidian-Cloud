# Network stuff
---
We mostly explain terms here

#### Server
A server could be a computer system or software app that provides services to ppl who connect to the same netwok.

#### Client
Since the server is the one hosting the info, the client simply requests the server to share resources, while the server would just be waiting for incoming requests.

#### Hub
Connection point for devices on the same network. 

When the network wanna send data, it sends it to the hub, and the hub will copy and send it to all devices connected, the device recieving it will accept it, while others will ignore it.

While reliable, slow.

#### Switch
Same as hub. But with a twist! How wacky! IKR??!

The switch can identify the devices unlike the hub, so rather than sending to everyone connected, it sends it to the designated device.

#### Router
Same but superior. YET AGAIN LOL!?!

It can send data between networks! How so very cool.
