# Data Compression

AKA bitrate reduction
Also see: [[lossy data compression]], [[lossless data compression]].

All networks have limited [[bandwidth]]. So data compression is used to reduce file size to be transmitted thru a network.

Take up less bandwidth.
Time to send thru a network is reduced.

Data compression is the reduction of bits by using fewer bits than the original representation.

Used when sending a file from a computer to another.

The receiver must have a decompression software.
