# LAN BUT W??
---
yeah, LAN but wireless

THE BOOK LITERALLY SAYS "using some sort of wireless connection method"

### What it?
Yeah basically its a [[1.1 LAN|LAN]] without the wires. It is still limited to a certain area, it still connects multiple computer systems, but its just wireless

It is commonly built on Wifi, switching out cables and using radio waves, and instead of wiring to a hub/switch, they use radio waves.

### Benefits
All the benefits of LAN but with the addition of:

Users can use their mobile devices connected to the network and be able to move around


### But a disbenefit (is that even a word)
Less safe
Intruders can connect to the network more easily since a physical connection is not required.
