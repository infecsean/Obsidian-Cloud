# Secure VPN
---
Everything on the VPN must be encrypted, authenticated, and sent along virtual tunnels.

Secure VPN Tech:
1. Internet Protocol Security Protocol (IPSec)
- Functions in both transport and tunnel mode.
- Allows secure transmission of data over public IP-based networks.
- Uses standard encryption algorithm to provide confidentiality
2. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) with encryption
- Much simpler than IPSec based VPNs.
- Doesnt require special client software cus all web servers and browsers support this method of providing a VPN.
