YEAH PANCAKE BABY

We all have PANs.

Its basically a LAN but you subscribed to the single user plan. It supports one person, and it typically has a short range, 10 meters or so.

PANs would normally contain laptop, mobile phone, drawing tablet, printer, idk.

A PAN using bluetooth to interconnect is called a **piconet**
