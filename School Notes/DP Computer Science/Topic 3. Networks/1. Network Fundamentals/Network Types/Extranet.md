# Extranet
---
A computer network that uses the internet to allow controlled access by authorized personnel to a LAN or WAN.

In an extranet, restricted information are hidden behind passwords or stuff, with the intention of not sharing everything with the public. 

This part of the network is called an extranet. Its kinda like an intranet, but allows authorized access by outsiders. 

A [[firewall]] is used to control access.
