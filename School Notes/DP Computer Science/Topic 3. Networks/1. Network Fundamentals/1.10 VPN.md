### The fuck is a VPN?
A computer network that connects multiple systems, kinda like [[1.1 LAN|LAN]] and [[1.4 WAN|WAN]], but allows clients from remote locations to connect to the network as if they were physically present and in the LAN.

It allows the creation of a LAN managed through an application, allowing clients to connect whereever, thru different networks (the internet).
