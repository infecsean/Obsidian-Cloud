# WDYM STANDARDS??
---
If a business is setting up a LAN with some clients and servers, if the hardware doesnt follow some standards, they might be incompatible, which may lead to a disfunctional network.

For example, if a computer system is developed with no standards, it may only support USB connections, with a switch that only supports ethernet. Leading to incompatibility.

So, standards describe the common ground for manufacturers to allow their products to communicate with others. This can be thought of as an international language that enables compatibility for all computer systems.
