1. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - network protocol that enables auto assigning IP addresses to clients. Improves efficiency.
2. Software Firewall - network security system that decides what come in and what come out
3. Name/SSID (Service Set Identification) - A set of 32 alphanumeric characters. Used to differenciate a [[WLAN]] from another. Case sensitive (CAPS and no cap matters)
4. NIC drivers (Network Interface Card driver) - Operates/Controls the hardware of the card. Kinda like a translator between the wireless card and the applications and the operating system.
5. OS (Operating System) - handles all the system resources. Manages all the protocols, hardware, applications to operate to be able to work correctly.
6. Security Software - All software that prevents unauthorized access.
7. WAP (WET ASS PUSSY) - Wireless Access Protocol. Specifies a set of protocols for accessing info over a mobile network. Supports most wireless networks and is supported by most OSs. Its almost disappeared. Modern browsers support HTML and dont use WAP for compatibility.
8. Web Browser - Application software used to find, retrieve, and display content on the WWW.
