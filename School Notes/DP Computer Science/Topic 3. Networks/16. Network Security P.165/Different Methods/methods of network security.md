# Methods of Network Security
---
1. Use a fucking passwork
2. install Antivirus (Not some shitty ones at that)
3. Software firewall on each device
4. Turn on/off wireless connectivity
5. Enable/Disable [[software components|SSID]] - Devices not in range must manually enter the correct SSID. Altho hackers can just find your SSID.
6. Block Network Access to MAC Address: MAC stands for Medium Access Control. It follows MAC protocol as a sub-layer of the [[1.1 Layers|data link layer]].
7. WEP Wireless Security (Wired Equivalent Privacy) 
8. WPA/WPA2 Security - Wi-Fi Protected Access. Considered the best protection other than a strong password (as of 2015)
9. Wireless Protected Setup (WPS)- idk why it just tells us to disable it.
- Methods: PIN, Push Button, Near Field Communication, USB Transfer
10. Prevent physical Access - EMF interferences, Directional Antennas, but cost a lot.
11. Router Hardware firewall - Built-in router firewall is the first line of defence to hacker attacks
12. Use encryption software to send sensitive files over the internet
