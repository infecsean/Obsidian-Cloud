# Symmetric-Key Encryption
---
```
aliases: Single Key Encryption, Secret Key Encryption
```

The same key is used for encryption and decryption.

How this works is that the sender will have a key and send it thru the network, to the receiver who also have the same key.

Normally, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used, it uses 128 to 256 bit keys. It provides an absurdly large number that cant really be brute forced.
