# Layers
---
software application devs have to follow some [[standards]] to be able to communicate over the [[1.4 WAN|WAN]]. A program is run to pass the request thru different layers and obtain the answer thru different layers.

The protocal in each layer carries out a sequence of equations.
Different layers have different protocals for info exchange. Organizing a network design in layers is breaking down its complexity, into distinct modules. 
This has the benefit of being able to quickly identify errors and problems within modules instead of the entire network.

### Packets
Every computer system that is connected to a network uses a specific process to transfer data thru the connection medium like cables or wifi.

Imagine two of these trying to send data to each other, the data sent must be understandable by both of them. Next, data is encoded to be suitable to send thru the network. And so the data is broken down into small groups called packets.

Packets contain a small amount of data, as well as other important information such as the destination. Then they are sent thru the network and reach their final destination.

ONLY bits, 0s and 1s, travel thru media. The receiving application gets the reassembled data in a suitable form.
