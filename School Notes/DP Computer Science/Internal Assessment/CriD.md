### Intro (~30 Secs)
- hello my student code is 051721-0036
- This is the video documentation for my computer science internal assessment cri D
- my product is a weather system package made for Unity 3D
- This product is made for my client Mark, who is an Environment Designer
- This weather system is going to enable my client to create customizable environments including grass, trees, weathers like rain and wind, and atmosphere like the sun and sky
- Throughout the video, i will be referring to this notepad on the left which includes my success criteria from criterion A, the test plan from criterion B, E and record of tasks.

### Actual Video
- So since this is a Unity 3D package, things will have to be done within unity, so lets open the project in unity
- This requires a bit of knowledge of the program if unfamiliar but since my client is, this should be intuitive

- In unity, we can see in the file hierarchy, my package contains
	- a shader for the grass
	- a shader for the trees
	- a particle system object for the rain
	- central weather controller
