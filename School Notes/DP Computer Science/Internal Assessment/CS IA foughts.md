### Set things
- Doing something with shaders

### Problems
- Does not seem like a game or a utility. idk how but i don't think its good for cs ia.

#### What defines a good cs ia game?
- Case Studies
	- Aim trainer - senior ia
		- Gameplay loop
			- train aim with randomly placed targets
		- Player agency
			- being able to choose what kind of trainer
			- customizable to each player probably
		- Purpose/win condition
			- Train aim until aim gud/aim gud
		- Algorithmic thinking
			- counting score, hit reg, game loop and menu stuff
	- Jigsaw puzzle - preston
		- gameplay loop
			- solve puzzles and stuff
		- player agency
			- able to import image files and create own puzzle
		- purpose/win condition
			- fun/solved puzzle
		- algorithmic thinking
			- splitting image into puzzle pieces, probably procedural teeth placement
	- Tetris - senior i think
		- gameplay loop
			- tetris, prevent blocks from reaching top
		- player agency
			- none, but can procedurally randomize to increase replayability
		- purpose/win condition
			- fun/world record i guess
		- algorithmic thinking
			- randomizing blocks, counting score, deleting completed rows, etc
	- My fucking trash weather sim
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">gameplay loop</mark>
			- tweak variables to change weather
		- player agency
			- being able to tweak variables to CHANGE WEATHER
		- purpose/win condition
			- relax??? fun even??/ NONE! ADD SOME knife rain or something
			- need to be a direct result of player's efforts
		- algorithmic thinking
			- player-variable interaction, shader changes, 
- Conclusion
	- My game is a game, but its more towards an experience rather than a game.
	- Other previous IAs are games that already have well-known gameplay loop
	- if i want to create a game, i better make the gameplay loop clear or else they wont know what the FUCK im talking about
	- its so god damn hard to make a unique game without people shitting on it, by people I actually mean my insecurity for the ia and what they will think of it
	- i saw a post on Reddit about a game, Proteus. It is a walking simulator, the focus is not on the walking mechanism, but on the walk itself. While other games would try to "gamify" their walking simulators, Proteus stayed true to its vision, a pure and beautiful experience of going out on a walk.
	- one could argue that this isnt related, as my game COULD just be a walking simulator, but compared to Proteus, its just much less. the only way i think that i can make it more of an experience/game rather than a "weather simulator" is actually building a game that has other mechanics
	- everything should be okay if i just do my shader magic and other mechanics right, one CORE problem, is procedural generation
	- maybe im a fool for trying to make a game for my cs IA
	- stuff if i "gamify it"
		- Add player movement and diagetic UI
		- Diagetic weather simulator
			- im thinking, the dome in Bladerunner 2049 where the girl who makes memories made an imaginary forest
			- making a panel outside to tweak the weather INSIDE the dome
			- a lil robot floaty guy that serves as tutorial/exit button to click on to be able to walk outside the dome, otherwise it would be like a treadmill inside that you can walk an infinite distance without hitting the dome walls
		- weather
			- trees - shader: leave sway, random branches/many meshes, wind/rain factor
			- grass - shader: sway, obstructed if player walks by, wind/rain factor
			- rain - lighting changes, rain particles, fog factor, rain factor, audio
			- lightning - lighting changes, audio, lightning particle/mesh?, storm factor?
			- day/night cycle - lighting changes, global illumination?, sun light ray physics
	- all of these contribute to overcomplicating my cs IA for the sake of fulfilling my insecurities. maybe just stop being a bitch lmao
