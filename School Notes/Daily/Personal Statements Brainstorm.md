# Personal Stamtent
---
What to write?
- Flesh out activities that you think can't be presented fully in a list

###### IGEM
- Won 2 gold medals
- I just filled into whatever they needed me to do -> 3D modeling
- Could talk about
	- Utilizing my variety of skills
	- Fitting into many roles
	- Creativity in problem solving
	- Combination of all of the above
- Stuff if yes
	- Separate yourself from "the rest along the ride" and the ones that contributed to getting this medal
	- So talk about maybe they had this really difficult problem that needed special equipment and lead into how I proposed a creative solution
- Why not
	- We've always won gold medals as Cindy said, idk how much that's worth
	- I just fill into what they need me to do

###### Medical Camp hackathon
- Won 1st place out of 6
- Could talk about
	- Flexibility as a team member
	- Variety of skills and 
- Stuff if yes
	- Dont try to portray leadership if theres none
	- Maybe talk about the bridge of communication through my thorough understanding of skills
- Why not
	- I only won because I have good skills in presentation and coding not because of leadership or teamwork

###### Chef
- I only got it 4th try -> perseverence?
- Could talk about
	- Mindset while failing
	- Training after failing
	- Changes that it brought
	- Interest and motivation to learn
- Stuff if yes
	- Is the process not important
	- If the only thing i want to show is perseverence then fucking cut down and add more examples
	- could also talk about the kitchen volunteer
- Why not
	- Not really much beyond a hard fucking flex about my license, prolly the only use i have for it right now which is really just sad
	- If i wanna talk about this, I would put it in some character trait section
	- It serves as a good examole to let uni get to know me through how i grow from this experience, to show that I can overcome challenges, which is a good trait?
	- But i cant show that i am cool epic guy without going into detail about this event
		- what like: "It took me 4 tries to nail this fuckin license" to cut down on word count, i can say like a for loop "for the first three tries, i failed" DONT SAY SOMETHING LIKE "each time more depressed than the last" it contradicts what you wanna show to the admissioner. Should be something like "I wanted to prove to myself that I can do it, I know that I wouldnt fail if I keep trying" or some cheesy bullshit

###### Gmae dev joueny?
- Impotant thing ot shwo is the significance to my future, meaning i have to show that I am good at game developing and i have much experience in it
- Whether i wanna show this thru a story
	- game jams and what i learned
	- initial interest and udemy courses
	- learning many skills
