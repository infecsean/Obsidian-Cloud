What is considered nostalgia-inducing and gaming addiction?
What separates emotional motifs in art and emotional manipulation?

###### To finish environments, i would need
if im gonna finish environment smoothly, i would need to finish:
- Learning environment design
- building design
- artstyle direction
- hardops
- painting skyboxes
- painting concrete and grass and shit
- concept art

so i would need to finish:
- learning concept art
- learning environment design
- finish map of town, school, houses, mind, home

###### Stuff about how my approach from reference to concept art to finished model
I want borderlands art style stuff -> get reference art
how to make stuff from reference art? no model from reference because plagarism
make own concept art from references -> make model from concept art
take picture of model -> try to draw the finished look on model
refine and apply texture on model

###### Prototyping process
- Stablize systems
	- Movement
	- Dialogue
	- Emotions
	- Cutscene & Transitioning
	- Interaction (fpe kit but replace movement)
	- Settings, UI, HUD
		- Menu anti-tutorial hint feature
		-  
- Make floor plan and stuff
- Block out the stuff in unity to test movement and the rest of the system
- Enter making process i guess
	- eg. making all the 3d models, fmod shit, audio, characters

thats the writing process lol

###### Converting shooter level design theory to mine
- Shooters -> My Game
	- Enemies:
		- Shooters
			- Gives the player something to do
			- Drives the plot
			- Serve as a challenge for player to overcome -> satisfaction
			- Variety of enemy types: Heavy, boss, small easy to dispose grunts
		- My game
			- Give the player something to do -> Player has to play with mood system
			- Drive the plot -> In the form of obstacles/Dialogue/social situations
			- Serve as challenge -> Parkour? Player has to manage moods
			- [[write thoughts#What's the ideal enemy type|Variety]]: Bosses must test both movement skill and 
	- Mission:
		- Shooters
			- Driven by mission from higher-ups
			- Objective: Escape, Destroy, Sabotage, Hold off, Take out
		- My game
			- Driven by self

###### What's the ideal enemy type?
- What's the ideal *BOSS* in my game?
	- What counts as a boss?
		- What doesnt count as a boss?
			- A Boss requires the player to overcome a challenge
			- A boss requires the player to demonstrate mastery of game mechanics
			- A boss requires the player to adapt to a new enemy (often with new mechanics)
			- A normal enemy gives practice
			- A normal enemy gets the player ready for the boss
			- A normal enemy can reuse attack patterns
			- Different enemies require player to approach in different angles
			- Enemies dont even have to be defeated, the player can use them to gain advantage

###### Characters
- Caretaker
	- Formal Atire
	- Sleeveless for extended arm
	- leads to special-made uniforms for caretakers
		- Idea: Buttons all the way to the shoulders, act also as a lock for extended arm
- 

###### Problems im goin thru
- Is my acccountability plan working out
	- my plan so far: achieved, but i dont feel enough stress over me
	- xNode isnt done, if i had spent more time on it, i wouldve finished a while ago
	- hammo stuff isnt easy to interpret i assume, so this week will have to be squeezed to finish both the xnode system and the hammo movement AND cs club movement will have to be done tomorrow
	- SAT and college stuff and math is not even touched, been playing too much horizon
- Problem evaluation
	- What is keeping me from catching up to my tasks goals?
		- Procrastination
			- Dont know where to start
				- Define a finished goal, not just "work on this"
					- CP: I could just finish it later
						- Then set goals for tomorrow so you wont have to do too much tomorrow
							- CP: Still can finish later
					- result: fear dont work for self-driven goals
					- strictly follow rules: work not done, no game
		- Gaming
			- Set a dedicated period of time for gaming
				- 1 hr morning
				- 2hrs in the afternoon for valorant i guess
				- 1 hr night, after dinner
- Game Features
	- Interaction Manager
		- [x] Mask System
		- [x] Mood system
		- [ ] Integrate with FPE Kit
	- UI
		- Main Menu
		- Pause menu (Notebook)
			- Map
			- Official Hints
			- Settings
			- Tips/Tutorial (diary)
		- Dialogue Menu
		- HUD
		- 
	- Cutscene/Transition Manager
		- What is it?
			- It manages the scenes although FPEKit already does that, so probably not
		- Why do we need this?
		- How are we gonna do this?
	- Floor Plan
		- Constraints
			- How long is the level?
				- Since it is not linear, and players will have to get familiar with the maps, probably a while
			- Any Cool stuff to show off?
				- Mood system, story, all should happen
			- Any progression related stuff?
				- Early levels should be less challenging
			- Audience?
				- preferably those who have gone through school's torment
		- Critical Constraints
			- What is the level's story, theme, and plot?
			- What flashy scenes (set-pieces) are there?
				- Dark room, only can use mood to guide you
				- (end sequence probs) emotional overload, your mood controls you, you can only suppress the emotions with opposite moods
				- Emotion create stuff (angry volcano scene red spike pierce up)
				- Hide other people (more common) and objects (to complete parkours)
				- 
			- What are technical constraints?
				- Character speed so jump gaps, height so ceilings
			- What action stuff will be present?
				- Puzzles (mood/normal), people, dialogues

###### Movemint
- What are natural 45 degree angles?
	- Theres an island![[Pasted image 20220716132700.png]]
	- bridges ![[Pasted image 20220716132711.png]]
	- rooftops
	- mountains
