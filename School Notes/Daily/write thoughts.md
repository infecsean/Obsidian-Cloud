What is considered nostalgia-inducing and gaming addiction?
What separates emotional motifs in art and emotional manipulation?

###### To finish environments, i would need
if im gonna finish environment smoothly, i would need to finish:
- Learning environment design
- building design
- artstyle direction
- hardops
- painting skyboxes
- painting concrete and grass and shit
- concept art

so i would need to finish:
- learning concept art
- learning environment design
- finish map of town, school, houses, mind, home

###### Stuff about how my approach from reference to concept art to finished model
I want borderlands art style stuff -> get reference art
how to make stuff from reference art? no model from reference because plagarism
make own concept art from references -> make model from concept art
take picture of model -> try to draw the finished look on model
refine and apply texture on model

###### Prototyping process
- Stablize systems
	- Movement
	- Dialogue
	- Emotions
	- Cutscene & Transitioning
	- Interaction (fpe kit but replace movement)
	- Settings, UI, HUD
		- Menu anti-tutorial hint feature
		-  
- Make floor plan and stuff
- Block out the stuff in unity to test movement and the rest of the system
- Enter making process i guess
	- eg. making all the 3d models, fmod shit, audio, characters

thats the writing process lol

###### Converting shooter level design theory to mine
- Shooters -> My Game
	- Enemies:
		- Shooters
			- Gives the player something to do
			- Drives the plot
			- Serve as a challenge for player to overcome -> satisfaction
			- Variety of enemy types: Heavy, boss, small easy to dispose grunts
		- My game
			- Give the player something to do -> Player has to play with mood system
			- Drive the plot -> In the form of obstacles/Dialogue/social situations
			- Serve as challenge -> Parkour? Player has to manage moods
			- [[write thoughts#What's the ideal enemy type|Variety]]: Bosses must test both movement skill and 
	- Mission:
		- Shooters
			- Driven by mission from higher-ups
			- Objective: Escape, Destroy, Sabotage, Hold off, Take out
		- My game
			- Driven by self

###### What's the ideal enemy type?
- What's the ideal *BOSS* in my game?
	- What counts as a boss?
		- What doesnt count as a boss?
			- A Boss requires the player to overcome a challenge
			- A boss requires the player to demonstrate mastery of game mechanics
			- A boss requires the player to adapt to a new enemy (often with new mechanics)
			- A normal enemy gives practice
			- A normal enemy gets the player ready for the boss
			- A normal enemy can reuse attack patterns
			- Different enemies require player to approach in different angles
			- Enemies dont even have to be defeated, the player can use them to gain advantage

###### Characters
- Caretaker
	- Formal Atire
	- Sleeveless for extended arm
	- leads to special-made uniforms for caretakers
		- Idea: Buttons all the way to the shoulders, act also as a lock for extended arm
- 

###### Problems im goin thru
- Is my acccountability plan working out
	- my plan so far: achieved, but i dont feel enough stress over me
	- xNode isnt done, if i had spent more time on it, i wouldve finished a while ago
	- hammo stuff isnt easy to interpret i assume, so this week will have to be squeezed to finish both the xnode system and the hammo movement AND cs club movement will have to be done tomorrow
	- SAT and college stuff and math is not even touched, been playing too much horizon
- Problem evaluation
	- What is keeping me from catching up to my tasks goals?
		- Procrastination
			- Dont know where to start
				- Define a finished goal, not just "work on this"
					- CP: I could just finish it later
						- Then set goals for tomorrow so you wont have to do too much tomorrow
							- CP: Still can finish later
					- result: fear dont work for self-driven goals
					- strictly follow rules: work not done, no game
		- Gaming
			- Set a dedicated period of time for gaming
				- 1 hr morning
				- 2hrs in the afternoon for valorant i guess
				- 1 hr night, after dinner
- Game Features
	- Interaction Manager
		- [x] Mask System
		- [x] Mood system
		- [ ] Integrate with FPE Kit
	- UI
		- Main Menu
		- Pause menu (Notebook)
			- Map
			- Official Hints
			- Settings
			- Tips/Tutorial (diary)
		- Dialogue Menu
		- HUD
		- 
	- Cutscene/Transition Manager
		- What is it?
			- It manages the scenes although FPEKit already does that, so probably not
		- Why do we need this?
		- How are we gonna do this?
	- Floor Plan
		- Constraints
			- How long is the level?
				- Since it is not linear, and players will have to get familiar with the maps, probably a while
			- Any Cool stuff to show off?
				- Mood system, story, all should happen
			- Any progression related stuff?
				- Early levels should be less challenging
			- Audience?
				- preferably those who have gone through school's torment
		- Critical Constraints
			- What is the level's story, theme, and plot?
			- What flashy scenes (set-pieces) are there?
				- Dark room, only can use mood to guide you
				- (end sequence probs) emotional overload, your mood controls you, you can only suppress the emotions with opposite moods
				- Emotion create stuff (angry volcano scene red spike pierce up)
				- Hide other people (more common) and objects (to complete parkours)
				- 
			- What are technical constraints?
				- Character speed so jump gaps, height so ceilings
			- What action stuff will be present?
				- Puzzles (mood/normal), people, dialogues

###### Movemint
- What are natural 45 degree angles?
	- Theres an island![[Pasted image 20220716132700.png]]
	- bridges ![[Pasted image 20220716132711.png]]
	- rooftops
	- mountains

# Thoughts 1?? (omg)
What does minami have that my mum dont?
- Unconditional love
- Being there when I need her
- Always available
- I've been there for them
- Emotional support each other

"I am busy but I still put you as priority"
- I know and I appreciate that.
- However, you are too ignorant of my problems for example

"You have problem, you talk to us and we can help"
- I tried, every time i get "you need to solve this", "you need to sort out your emotions", "if this problem can be solved this way, do it", you always speak of me in terms of "problems". I just want someone to help me solve my problems.
- I ask you this and that, you respond with "ive done what i could", i may not need dr zhao but if we cant solve this problem by communicating, then i need a therapist

- You see the problem, but instead of helping me fight it and solve it, you tell me why i need to solve it and leave me alone to solve it by myself

Everything is still about you, and what you want, not me.
- Everything you think is in my best interest, is only because its in your best interest

- just some thoughts
	- illusion of a happy household
		- we try so hard to make it seem like we are living a happy life, we travel around the world, we go watch movies.
		- I needed none of that, i only wanted you to ask me how im doing
			- by that, i dont mean "whats your problem? when are you going to move on", but "how are you doing? you can talk to me about anything i promise ill still love you, whatever it is we can solve it together" at least that gives me the illusion of comfort
	- "am i worth something to you"
		- idk why but i legit cried, imagining asking them this question.

# Thoughts 5????
Theory: I need enough energy to do stuff i can handle
- Lets say that every activity i do can be evaluated in stress/intensity levels
- Maybe I cant force myself to do work at home because i have no energy left to do high intensity work
	- of course, with the exception of "due tomorrow" work that breaks the pattern because its not completely a willpower thing
- Lets define intensity level as the amount of energy needed to do a task
- It goes from -1 to 1, -1 as those that restore energy, 1 as those that drain energy

| Task            | Energy Level | Satirical comments                         |

| College Essay   | 0.6          | Talk about myself, often takes a while     |
| Valorant        | -0.5~0.2     | good game, bad game, nuff said             |
| other games     | -0.5         | might as well sleep                        |

# Thoughts 7? (new update)
L'HÃ´pital's rule is a mathematical tool that can be used to evaluate limits of the form $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, which may not be easily evaluated using other techniques. It is named after the French mathematician Guillaume de l'HÃ´pital, who introduced the rule in the 18th century.

L'HÃ´pital's rule states that if the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a is of the form $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, and if the function f(x) and its derivative f'(x) are both defined and have finite values in a neighborhood of a (excluding a), then the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is equal to the limit of f'(x) as x approaches a.

The rule can be written mathematically as:

$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$

where f(x) and g(x) are functions, and a is a real number.

L'HÃ´pital's rule can be used to evaluate limits that cannot be found using other
