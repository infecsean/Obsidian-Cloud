Prolly gonna name it "High Way" cus of how you feel like you're fucking high while playing this

## What's keeping me going
If this works out and I ship my game under the current situation, i wanna document how my mindset changed. So basically I got insane. Yesterday I wanted to scrap my game because I was thinking that if the way to keep myself going is to believe in myself, and the only way to make me believe in myself is to believe in what im working on, and the only way to make me believe in what im working on is to have a not-shit-concept. yeah. A concept that doesn't suck. Deep down I knew that nobody would wanna play a driving simulator with emotional "sequences" and depression-filled atmosphere. But then I gave it another chance. What if I spiced up the gameplay? What if it's not that I loathed creating an open world, but I was just lazy and the excitement I had for the game just didn't overpower the laziness I had?
### Core Mechanics
- Driving
- Delivery
- Wacky Visual and control effects

### Gameplay Loop

- Player delivers packages to destinations between towns and so yeah. oh yeah there's sometimes a twist. So far the levels are as follows:
	- Packages
		- Deliver a time machine. It may or may not mess with the flow of time so cars on the highway will be going 80 mph one moment and 0 the next. sounds exciting.
		- Deliver a 10 billion kg package that literally changes the center of mass of the car. Excitement level: meh, 5/10. But something is better than nothing.
		- A giant fucking disco ball. On a high way. Good luck.
	- Passengers
		- A guy who demands eye contact while you drive. Sounds great.
	- Effects (not necessarily a gameplay loop but i wanna achieve emotional-ness?)
		- Cigarettes: I want to make a level up system around cigarettes. Cigs are the main way of saving the game for the player. To save the game, the player smokes a cig, which brings blissfulness to the rather stressful delivery missions. The more the player smokes (saves)(levels up smoking), the more often the player can smoke (addiction)(but also serves as a way to )
		- Alcohol baby: Drunk, your mechanical skills just went out the window and so you go on a drive.
### Storyline
- The player needs money because...
	- His mom is dying and needs meds
	- All he knows is driving
- He keeps getting into weirder and weirder delivery missions, all of which are very dangerous and could fail the game. that's sort of the gameplay loop.


> off topic here: I think the thing with player motivation and whether or not to give players a motivation is quite a double edged sword. One one hand giving the player a motivation to play the game ex. it's their job, someone is dying, saving a princess, etc. gives the player something to strive for. But on the other hand, losing that motivation or rather even worse, seeing through that motivation as it is, a tool that is used to drive the player, then the player will most likely immediately lose interest. On the other side of the coin, not giving the player motivation, games like killing others are meant to be just for the fun of the gameplay and not story driven...huh. so i guess what im trying to say here is that games that are driven by story has to give the players a motivation.
