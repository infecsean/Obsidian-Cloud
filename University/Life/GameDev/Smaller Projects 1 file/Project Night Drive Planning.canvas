That's the main motivator of the mechanic.\nIt also makes the camera effect crispy clean, like clarity of mind.\n\nMain problem: Can't motivate the player without providing them with benefits to smoking, but at the same time I want players to be motivated by the mood of smoking not the benefits.\n\nSolution?: Make them overlap then. Benefits such as saving progress already provides catharsis and stress relief. Mood will be filled by how you control the players' actions.\n\nThe player cannot smoke while driving\n- Makes it so that the player will only smoke while:\n\t- Waiting for mission start\n\t- After mission end\n\t- Casually strolling\n\t- Exploring\n- And not while\n\t- Driving\n\t- Cutscenes"}
