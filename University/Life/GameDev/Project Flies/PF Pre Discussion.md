# What is this project?
---
I am doing this project as my first game to post on steam because I am not competent enough to make my dream game YET.
Am I trying to escape from my excessively planned cas game? maybe. Do I think I can finish it before 12th grade is done?

### Arguments for switching to this project
- I can use this game as a pilot to introduce players to my style, effectively setting up an existing audience for my dream game (school)
- Experiment with marketing
- Expand my audience
- Learning more skills to be competent enough to fill in my vision for the dream game
- Clean slate to follow through with a more concrete plan (gantt chart n stuff)

### Arguments AGAINST this project
- Common words of wises
	- Dont try to do two things at once!
		- Im not, im temporarily setting down my school project
	- Be a man and go through with your choice!
		- Nah, make a better choice based on the current situation
	- You'll fall into the trap of never achieving anything!
		- This, I am scared of.
- Quite a pain to have to explain in CAS reflection

### Living things that i wanna include
- Flies
- Spiders
~~- Ants~~
- Pet Dog (for existential questioning)
- Rats
~~- cockroaches (i cant not include it or else complaints)~~
- HUMAN

- During the storyline, have the guy bring out papers and shit (a form of text in games) to either bring lore, or story

### Traditions
- Honor the passing of others by consuming the dead.
- Worship or respect is conveyed through consumption

### Fly fax (Overthinking)
- Can live around 15 days, 2~3 days without food
- Attracted to blue color, deterred from warms like yellow
- Sleep for 800~1100 mins a day (IKR??), they usually find a safe place before sunset
- Cannot see red (fuck this shit tho, motifs FTW)
- Can see almost 360 around
- Short-sighted (2 meters?) (source says "A FEW YARDS" fuck you)
- Rub hands to stay clean
- Innate Phototaxis
==- Can fly for minutes before resting==
==- From starving to completely full takes several minutes==
- Love rotten meat
- Experience time 4x
- Need to eat 2 microliters of food a day
- Fog will limit the range of view for the player to achieve short-sightedness and creepiness
