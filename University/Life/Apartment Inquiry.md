Hi, 

Me and my future roommate are planning on taking a tour of your apartment this Saturday. We are both male, without pets. 
Our planned move-in date is ideally April but we can also move in May.
We hope to get an apartment with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, around 1000 square feet.
Our acceptable price range is $2000 to $2600.
