Cultural imperialism is the overtaking of a culture by a more dominant culture, and the diffusion of cultural icons is the spreading of, cultural icons, around the world. I think that there can be a balance so long as the imperialists go in with an open mind, like trying the local food before they change it or replace them with their own food. A great example of this is probably Indian curry, where when Great Britain colonized India at one point, they invented their own form of Indian curry I forgot the name but it shows that while they were colonized, their culture could still be spread all the way to Great Britain. Arguments for why they can not be balanced associates imperialism with the automatic lost of culture since instances of imperialism spreading culture is very rare.
