- Why is argot important for the gay community?
- How are other languages incorporated into lavender language?

Lavender language is language that is used by the LGBTQ+ community, mostly categorised by researchers to be spoken by cisgender gay men. An example of a lavender language is Polari, which is a kind of argot used by the gay community, characterised by its tendency towards rhyming. This kind of argot is important to the gay community because historically, there have been laws forbidding presence of gay people, so they had to resort to a secret language that doesn’t compromise them by being too distinct, but obvious enough that people of the gay community know that each other is gay. Other languages such as English are incorporated into lavender language through their role of a “disguise”, for example, Polari is mostly conventional English, but with a few code words that are used to substitute English words like “police” to communicate with each other in the midst of danger.
