**Field Experience Report**

You will write one 3-4 page field experience. Field Experiences ask you to step outside of your normal routines and have an experience that is new to you--these need to be NEW experiences (meaning you are completing it for the first time for this class). All of the field experience options are outlined below.

The report asks you to integrate ideas from your chosen experience with concepts discussed in the course. As you write, be specific in referring to the ideas and reference the materials you discuss. When you refer to an idea in the text, you need to define it (so that I know you know what it means), and then explain why the experience is an example of that. Incorporate concepts and terms from the course: You must include at least **5 terms** from the course and put them in bold (see the rubric for more information). This helps demonstrate your knowledge of the concepts discussed in class.

_**For example**_: If you choose to talk about identity you must first explain how identity is defined in our course materials. Then, try to connect the themes in your Field Experience to the concepts discussed in class (including TedTalks, textbook chapters, and other supplemental readings).

Finally, as you go through your experience, consider the [Scale of Intercultural Sensitivity](https://utah.instructure.com/courses/922143/files/150294493?verifier=RwbOo5Jmz7HWJfxqXm5deIjVaMwDHlQ21vncUBe2&wrap=1) and reflect on it in relation to your experience. 

 Be specific in referring to the idea and cite the pages where the information can be found in the text(s). Each report should be carefully proofread and demonstrate a high level of competence in written communication.


3. Literature Study: Similar to the film analysis, read a piece of literature from another culture or a sub-culture within your own culture.  What does it teach you about that cultures’ communication? What other aspects of the text connect to the themes presented in our class?
