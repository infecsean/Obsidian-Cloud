The group: Game Developers

Description of culture/values: Game developers are often known to be either pretty laid back and chill people, or jerks that knows everything and forces an entire team to go with their plan. In all seriousness, Game Dev culture itself is made up of people who are passionate for their craft, people who are willing to pursue what they love despite lower salaries, high competition, and notorious crunch (defined later). Their values include passion, creativity, and some of the time, quality (some of the time because recently it has been questioned).

Examples of slang, argot, cant, jargon
Slang: Easter Egg (a kind of secret lil thing the devs hide to reward curious minds), smurf (people of high skill dwelling in low skill games), grind (working hard to achieve certain goals)
Argot: Min-maxing (maximising desirable attributes for optimal gameplay), Power creep (imbalance in gameplay due to new content surpassing effectiveness of old content), crunch (working overtime to ship a completed game)
Cant: Speedrun (to do something as fast as possible), toggle (hacking), buff (improved effectiveness)
Jargon: Collision Box (invisible box that games use to detect when objects are in contact with each other), LOD(Level of detail, usually of an object, used for optimising performance), Rigging (the process of attaching controllers for a character model used for animation)

Explanation of how that language relates to their culture: The language of game developers is mostly just used to communicate complicated stuff with a few words (or letters even!) for efficiency. Sometimes it is used as a kind of funny sarcastic comment between developers to spite their dreadfully unfinished game. But some of the time the language (like slangs) are jointly derived from game players and the communities that devs are appealing to.
