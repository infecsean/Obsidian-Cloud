Purpose:  
To understand the changing views on sexual orientation and gender identity in the United States. 

Instructions  
1.    Using the library or the U's online library site, research the history of sexual orientation and gender identity in the United States.   
2.    You may look at information on legal policies, examine the language used in older textbooks the U library may still have on file, or find sources that lay out the history of views regarding sexual orientation and gender identity in the United States.   
3.    Summarize what you find. 

Conclusions  
1.    What did you learn from your research?   
2.    Was there anything that surprised you in your research?   
3.    Why do you think changes have occurred?

I found a study from 1998 on the relationship between suicide risk and the sexual orientation of the subject. https://utah-primoprod.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/1g0gstr/TN_cdi_pubmedcentral_primary_oai_pubmedcentral_nih_gov_1508407. The article starts out by stating the fact that there have been an increasing rate of suicide among us adolescents and so started to survey and find out different factors affecting the rate of suicide. Basically long story short, results show that there is a strong correlation between being bisexual or homosexual and suicide ideation, self harm, that sort of stuff on "males"; females? meh. not so much.

1. I learned that whether or not it is directly correlated, non-heterosexual "males" have, according to the research done by this guy, a higher chance of suicide than heterosexual "males". For the history part of the assignment, the article mentioned that previous research have only been done on groups consisting of only non-heterosexual subjects, and so this article is new in a way that explores whether or not the previous research really proves that being non-heterosexual does increase your chance of suicide. This means that historically, people more or less have used statistical evidence that non-heterosexual people have high suicide rates against people who are non-heterosexual. Oh! how politically incorrect they have been!
2. Yeah, the results surprised me, but not too much. I expected, from how I have seen society work, that minorities tend to be more at risk of suicide. However, I am surprised that the correlation is only seen in "male" subjects and am thoroughly perplexed as to why! this relationship isn't seen in females. Maybe because males are stereotypically expected to be "manly"? So they are picked upon more often? Resulting in further isolation? fascinating.
3. The only change that have occurred in this article is that they have only then (in 1998) thought to check if homosexuality/bisexuality really increases your chance of suicide. To that change, I would say that that happens because people are becoming aware of their sexual orientation and therefore rising in population, calling for a more thorough research conducted on the subject.
