**Part II (2-3 pages)**

- Looking back on what we've discussed in this class in terms of how we act, what we say, and what we do how have your behaviors changed toward or with people who are different from you? For example, maybe you are now more sensitive to gestures and what they mean to someone from another culture. You could also look back on the discussions that you have participated in throughout the semester with your classmates'; how have reading about and responding to their unique experiences and perspectives shaped/changed/altered how you respond to them and others that don't have your same perspectives? Has the class provided you with any specific ways to communicate more effectively?
