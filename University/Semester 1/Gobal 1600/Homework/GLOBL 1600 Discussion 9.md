Write 1-2 paragraphs

Historically, colonialism has referred to colonizing different parts of the world to gain resources, power, control, and convenience of trade. Byproducts of colonization often include harming the local population, exploiting them, or even genocides. They would also suck them dry of their natural resources and is looked down upon in modern society. That’s why there’s a modern way of colonialism. This may come in the form of economic control, political control, or territorial control, but with a more subtle approach to colonizing them, one could also say that they are more indirect in their colonization.

One form of modern colonialism today mentioned above is economic control. There is a term that arose to describe, more or less, Latin American regions that are politically or economically unstable and rely solely on one or a few exports like bananas, called ”Banana Republics”. This form of modern colonialism include interventions like dominance over the production of, say, bananas, in the favor for American corporations, exploitation of natural resources, or supporting operations that align with American economic interest.
