### Structure
- Intro
	- Address the question of "Who am I?"
	- Define Identity
	- What is it that makes up my unique identity (but dont go into detail)
	- "On the topic of identity, I like to think of myself as two separate entities, one defined by external factors, one by internal factors such as...expereinces and shit"
- Body 1
	- My identity as who people say I am
	- Include example from Ted talk
		- People say I come from what country what country
- Body 2
	- My identity as what my experiences shapes me
	- How I like to define my identity
	- My identity as what I am most involved in right now
		- I am a game developer, but I haven't touched my projects in months
		- I am a Taiwanese person in and out, but when people ask me about my culture, I don't know how to answer
		- I am constantly torn between two identities, trying to bridge my external and internal
	- Refer to example from Tantum
		- One's identity isn't merely a one-dimensional character.
		- Identity crisis: My first identity crisis
			- I remember my first identity crisis like it was yesterday. I was sitting in the back seat of my parent's car on the way to a restaurant. One moment I was okay, but the next, I was not. I was overwhelmed by all these different emotions: shock, confusion, fear, anxiety, hopelessness. I suddenly lost all sense of self and who I am and broke down crying. My parents' reactions were the least of my concerns, for I had to find out who I am and what was wrong with me. The process was steady after I had calmed down. I abandoned myself and it was of utmost importance for me to rebuild it. So I did, starting with my purpose of existence. The process is rather tedious so I won't go into detail, but my gut feelings told me that the most important thing to figure out was my existence, and that reflects on to myself to this day in my daily existential daydreams.
- Conclusion
	- In the end, I feel like what makes up my unique identity isn't what people say it is, nor controlled by my actions, but rather by my experiences that include external and internal factors. I like to think of it as a sort of net in the vast ocean, catching whatever flows into it, and perhaps by chance, if the object is sharp or deformed, cut the net or entangle it into a different shape.
