**Argument Summary:**

The Argument Summary is a summary of an essay that does more than just repeat, in order, each and every idea of the essay. You need to summarize the argument. This is a different and more complex task. In this argument summary, you (as the author) will teach your reader about the essay and you will also enter the conversation with your own emphasis and argument. To begin this process, ask yourself the following questions:

- What is important about this essay: Why do the arguments in this essay matter? Who is the author of the essay talking to? What is there to be learned and gained by understanding this article? What is the key issue in this argument?
- What is the primary claim (thesis) of this essay?
- What are the supporting claims—evidence, sub-arguments, etc.—and how do they work with the thesis?
- What do you as the primary reader of this essay find to be the most interesting? And how can you make that the most interesting feature for your reader?

Put another way: a successful argument summary will do two things: 1) summarize the argument (which is a different task than summarizing the essay) and 2) analyze the essay and thereby give a third-party who hasn’t read the article/essay an overview of the content, but also a sense of the value of the argument—why it is important and how someone might use it.
