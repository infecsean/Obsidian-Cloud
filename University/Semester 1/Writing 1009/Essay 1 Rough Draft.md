Language is a tool for people to communicate with, it is a medium that transfers abstract ideas into a commonly understood language with shared meaning between people. However, there exists loopholes in the system of language that are exploited to change the meaning of ideas. Such is the situation seen in Kelly Coryell's Essay "All Words Matter: The Manipulation behind 'All Lives Matter'". In the essay, Coryell leads the audience through an example of how language is manipulated and misused to undermine the context of a situation. Specifically, the author explains that the phrase "All lives matter" as a response to "Black lives matter" during the BLM movement dismisses the movement's message that the black community has been mistreated in the past. The author then proceeds to go through different contexts of how the phrase is used and explaining why they are inappropriate. It can be reasonably assumed that the central theme of the essay is about the misuse of language. Since Coryell wrote this essay during a first year writing course, the essay's primary audience should be other academics who understand language, while indirectly addressing an audience who have used these kinds of ways to manipulate language into a weapon. This essay will be analyzing the literary devices the author employed to persuade the reader, such as the ways the author appeals to the audience and the usage of rhetorical questions.
