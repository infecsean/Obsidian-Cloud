- My ESL teacher 
	- During middle school, while I was still under the traditional education system, my name was made up of my Chinese initials, Y.K. It was a name that I was insecure about from when I had to introduce myself with it, mostly because I was not confident enough to live up to that uniqueness. This insecurity broke out even further when I introduced myself in my ESL (English as Second Language) class, and the teacher confronted me in front of the entire class saying that he's not going to "call a human being two letters", then proceeded to tell me to change it. This was back when I was still obedient and thought that everything the authorities said was right, but this was the last straw. In an act of defiance, I named myself Sean, which there was already two others in the class, since it was a bafflingly common name where I'm from, and kept this instance of disrespect imbedded in my identity. I sworn to myself to be good enough to defend against this kind of abuse in the future.
