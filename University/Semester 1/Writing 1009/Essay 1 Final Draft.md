Language is a tool for people to communicate with, it is a medium that transfers abstract ideas into a commonly understood language with shared meaning between people. However, there exists loopholes in the system of language that are exploited to change the meaning of ideas. Such is the situation seen in Kelly Coryell's Essay "All Words Matter: The Manipulation behind 'All Lives Matter'". In the essay, Coryell leads the audience through an example of how language is manipulated and misused to undermine the context of a situation. Specifically, the author explains that the phrase "All lives matter" as a response to "Black lives matter" during the BLM movement dismisses the movement's message that the black community has been mistreated in the past. The author then proceeds to go through different contexts of how the phrase is used and explaining why they are inappropriate. It can be reasonably assumed that the central theme of the essay is about the misuse of language. Since Coryell wrote this essay during a first year writing course, the essay's primary audience should be other academics who understand language, while indirectly addressing an audience who have used these kinds of ways to manipulate language into a weapon. This essay will be analyzing the literary devices that the author employed to persuade the reader.

In the essay, the author attempts to persuade the audience that the phrase of "All lives matter" is problematic through appealing to ethos, pathos, and logos. First off, appealing to ethos means to appeal to credibility, and the author does so through citing popular news sites and their corresponding authors as authority figures. For example, she provides an article on the same topic from the UK news site The Guardian to support her argument that it is not that "All lives matter" is wrong, but that "Black lives matter, too" (Graff, p318). She connects other author's ideas and uses them to support her argument and hence make her more reliable by using reliable sources. This is an important device as she is pointing out the already existing status and the scale of this issue by stating that this isn't a new problem. Next, appealing to pathos means to appeal to a person's emotions, and the author does so by using anecdotal evidence and other heated topics like relating herself to being a minority. For example, she starts the essay by taking us into her past and describing how words was always the main weapon used against her, this contributes to letting the audience know that she has suffered because of the misuse of language (Graff, p312). Finally, appealing to logos is the appeal to logic, using logical reasoning to persuade the audience, and the author does so through the usage of statistical evidence. Such is seen in the essay when she points out that "The median wealth of Black families was only 10 percent of the median wealth of white families" (Graff, p315). This is an important technique as it allows her to arrive at the logical conclusion that black lives are values less than the white, and hence wrapping back to her argument that the BLM movement isn't about human rights as much as it is about equality of all humans. Incorporating ethos, pathos, and logos into persuasion is crucial for effectively reaching and convincing the audience. Appealing to ethos establishes the author's credibility and authority, reinforcing their argument through reputable sources and expert opinions. Appealing to pathos connects with the audience emotionally, making arguments relatable by sharing personal experiences and evoking empathy. Appealing to logos uses logical reasoning and evidence, grounding the argument in facts. By skillfully balancing these elements, the author builds a compelling case that engages the audience's trust, emotions, and intellect, enhancing the persuasiveness of their message.

One thing that I found particularly interesting was how Coryell pieced together her argument. Some might point out that her essay is overly repetitive to the point where the reader gets tired of her simply re-justifying her argument again and again by the midpoint of the essay. While it is true that she does restate her argument a lot, I found it to be acceptable, and in a way, strengthen her argument. By repeatedly supporting her argument, she ensures that nobody in the audience could possibly miss her point, thereby appealing to a fuller audience. She constructs her essay starting with an anecdote to introduce the audience how words have changed her life, which serves to explain her personal motive and a real life example of a victim of language manipulation. She then uses the techniques mentioned above to support her argument that language can be used as a weapon. The repetition in the essay comes from the various sources she cites as evidence that this is a widespread problem while also maintaining credibility and advancing her argument. For example, she cited Adichie's essay on feminism explaining that feminism isn't about human rights but about excluding one gender; she also explains later on from another source that "it isn't only black lives matter, it's black lives matter, too", giving an example of literally how the two phrases mean different things (Graff, p314). Her argument is generally constructed as "say what I'm going to say", "Say it", "Say what others say", "Say what we said". In a sense, she isn't restating her claim, but using other sources as counterclaims.

In the end, understanding the usage of words as weapons of discrimination is crucial in the real world as it allows individuals to assess information critically, navigate societal debates, and resist manipulation in a world where words hold immense power and influence. In essence, Coryell's essay underscores the importance of skepticism in the face of language and the impact it has on shaping perceptions and attitudes. Through her skillful use of rhetorical strategies, she persuades her readers to examine the words they use and what they mean when they say "All lives matter", ultimately emphasizing the power of language in influencing our society's values. The understanding of language misuse not only benefits academics by enhancing critical thinking but also has a profound impact on individuals who may use language as a weapon, promoting more respectful and constructive interactions in both scholarly and everyday discourse.
