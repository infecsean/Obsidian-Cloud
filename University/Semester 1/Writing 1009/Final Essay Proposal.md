- Introduction
- BP1
	- They say: Monsters are created to warn others or scare others so that they would be cautious.
		- Examples: Tales of "White doe" from one of the texts created by native American
	- I Say: The Frankenstein Monster is not only a cautionary tale for our morals (when he created something he cant be responsible for), but is even more so of a cautionary tale for our own natural instincts (curiosity and the thirst for creation). Now I'm not saying that creation is not a natural instinct, but...
- BP2
	- They Say: Monsters are created to encapsulate the concept of horror so that it can be easily projected to anything the majority of people don't like.
		- Example: People are monsters. Terrorists are monsters.
	- I Say: While terrorists are people who have done very bad things, people who we deem as terrorists such as kids who become school shooters and suicide bombers are people who have, in one way or another, been wronged by society and became so filled with hatred that they let it out on the people who hurt them. Such is the monster seen in Frankenstein.

	- They say: Monsters are created for fun, for making people feel scared because we are too bored.
		- Vampires, zombies, and so on, are monsters that are fictional and people would be scared because of their interesting concept.
	- I say: In a way, Frankenstein's monster is created with the intention of "having fun", seeing that it was started as a "ghost story" game. However, I would say that it goes deeper than that. Monsters are also created because of their comfort to us, to the human condition. We are tired of being just humans. If people invented superheroes, there should definitely be super-beings that terrorize us.
- existential dread behind the human condition.
### Proposal

Monsters have been terrorizing the human mind ever since they were brought into existence. Whether it is ghost stories that keep the children from sleeping, tales that warn others about the dangers of the wild, or just for fun and scares. Over the years, people have mostly agreed that monsters are created for its utility, like keeping children from going out after dark, carry a connotation that people can project onto others that communicate their monstrous qualities, or just scaring people for fun. However, I would argue that the utility behind monsters lies behind the wall of our consciousness and through the analysis of how monsters are created, we can understand ourselves better. While monsters have traditionally been viewed as external threats, symbols, or sources of entertainment, looking closer will reveal that it actually serves a larger purpose, as a mirror that reflects our deepest fears, moral quandaries, and existential concerns. This essay aims to explore the potential of monsters, not the warnings that they give, nor its symbolism, or its shock value, but the journey into our complexities and existence.
