First off, for the Emotions category, I gravitated towards the PANAS Questionnaire and the CES-D Questionnaire. I found the other tests to be lacking in detail for the descriptions, and I was also interested in finding out about my positive and negative affect and whether or not I have depression. My expectations going into the tests were that I had moderate positive and negative affectivity and a low depression score. The PANAS test in appendix A showed that I had low affectivity for both positive and negative emotions. I was shocked with the findings but I am also shocked with my reaction since I am generally not very reactive towards anything and I should probably have expected that. This is also in line with the Signature Strengths survey I did that showed Zest to be my lowest strength. In his book Authentic Happiness, Martin Seligman provided an example of a man with low positive affectivity, whose story I could somewhat relate to, as I was concerned with having weak positive emotions and might be vulnerable to depression (Seligman, 2002). The Depression test in appendix B came out to be alright, I was only mildly depressed, which sounds terrible but still a very low score. Overall, in this category, I learned that I can still be happy while having low affectivity and mild depression.

In the next category, for Engagement, I chose the Optimism Questionnaire and the Gratitude survey. I was always curious as to how optimistic I am as a person, since I can be very optimistic for others while being completely opposite to myself. I expected myself to be about average in Optimism and above average in gratitude. The results in Appendix C showed that I show high permanence for good events and low permanence for bad events, and low pervasiveness for both good and bad events, and I scored a 1 in hopefulness. Pervasiveness is a measure of whether or not I think of an event as universal or specific to my scenario, but my only confusion was that I would think that being pervasive towards good events is just as bad since I would think pervasiveness is a negative quality to have (Seligman, 2002). In the end, I wasn’t surprised that I am about average in the hopefulness score since I am sometimes hopeful and sometimes not. The gratitude test (Refer to Appendix D) result got me happy at first, since I expected the mean score to be the average score, but in fact, I scored in the 25th percentile in gratitude. The thing that surprised me the most was that most people are generally very grateful, but then again, there isn’t a reason not to be grateful. Overall, everything seemed normal in this category.
## Flourishing

### PERMA

### PERMA Meter
Measures Flourishing

Next up in the Flourishing category, I took the PERMA test and the PERMA Meter test. The tests are supposed to show how much I am flourishing, which I expected to be different in each category but generally, average in every category except relationships. The results shown in Appendix E indicated that I am on average, flourishing quite well, except for the high score in loneliness which I predicted as I still haven’t found a lot of meaningful friendships yet. This is also an opportunity for me to go out and actually improve my PERMA score and focus on finding relationships. I was also surprised to find that I scored low on Meaning in Appendix F, as I often think of myself as having a lot of meaning behind my actions.
## Life Satisfaction

### Satisfaction with Life Scale

### Approaches To Happiness
Measures Happiness
![[Pasted image 20230927110047.jpg]]

Next, in the Life Satisfaction category, I took the satisfaction in life test and the Approach to happiness test as they seemed very general and I just wanted an overview of how satisfied I was. I expected to score lower in the first test and higher in the second. The results in Appendix G indicates that I am only slightly satisfied with my life, which doesn’t surprise me, but I do hope to improve that score over time. Results shown in Appendix H has it that I am higher in the good life and meaningful life but lower in the pleasant life. I was not surprised with the first two but I had an unreasonably low score on the pleasant life. I had no reason to think that my life was unpleasant, since everything was going smoothly; however I do remember thinking of “the pleasant life” as a life without discipline and hence I considered them to be negative traits. Overall, this category of tests made me realize that tests are really just tests, and may have flaws that show a subjective view of my happiness.
## Meaning Questionnaires
### Meaning in Life Questionnaire
Measures Meaningfulness

### Close Relationship Questionnaires
Measures Attachment Style
![[Pasted image 20230927112727.jpg]]

For the final category, Meaning, I did the Meaning in Life test and Close Relationships test, since I got mixed results in previous tests on meaning and I just want to get to know myself and my attachment style. The results in Appendix I indicated a high meaning and a high search score, explaining that although I have found a purpose in life, I am continuing to search for new meaning, which is exactly how I feel. On the other hand, I found the attachment survey (Refer to Appendix J) to be interesting as I came out to be a low-anxiety, high-avoidance partner, also known as a preoccupied person, and that my relationships can be interfered by my negative emotions, which is very like me. This is very useful information as I am currently entering a relationship and don’t really know much about myself. It would be beneficial for me to focus on trying to open up to my partner and talking about things, which I have noticed in my relationship.

In the end, these are all just surveys, which are nice but still doesn’t directly answer my question: Am I happy? After this survey, I knew myself a little more and knew what direction I should be heading towards. While I can’t say that my happiness is where I want it to be, I can say that I will definitely arrive at a better place if I head towards the right direction.
