Question: The affinity argument by Socrates states that the soul must share the properties of the invisible and the divine, but how does he know that just because his idea of the soul share the same properties to that of immortality, it has to be immortal? I guess this is more of a criticism than a question.

Comment: I think one of the opposing thoughts I have are that Socrates seem to generate generalized/universal principles that must hold true for his arguments. Hence the criticism.

Criticism: His theory of recollection supports his argument for the immortality of the soul, but the soul must exist sometime somehow right? So based on that, there must also be an end to the soul, is it not so? (Certainly). Hence it might not be so immortal.
