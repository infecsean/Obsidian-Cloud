Question: If truth is present in so much of the political world, why would people need to lie?

Comment: I like how he treats truth as a sort of object, a currency if you will, for example "regime of truth" or "economy of truth", it leads me to think of what truth has become in the modern world.

Criticism: Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think Foucault explicitly defines truth. He talks about how truth is produced, how politics and power take advantage of truth, what truth isn't, but not what truth is. kinda confusing.
