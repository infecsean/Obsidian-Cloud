Question: Why does Socrates insist that where there are teachers of things that give knowledge, there must also be learners? Is it not common that there are teachers without learners and vice versa?

Comment: I like how in Socrates and Meno's philosophical discussion, they base their questions off of their previous consensus. So that on multiple occasions, they realized that their consensus was wrong and had to change it.

Criticism: In Socrates' argument that knowledge is recollected, he used the example of the slave boy by only asking him questions and claims that all the answers that the boy gives is of his own. I would argue that the phrasing of Socrates' questions are very often rhetorical and would hence hide the answers in the question itself.
