Question: How do we decide if an action is for the betterment of humanity?

Comment: I like this view of utilitarianism, it seems like a great idea on paper, as who doesn't want everybody to be happy? But again no action pleases all. I'm all for utilitarianism but I think the modern concept of utilitarianism has changed.

Criticism: Let's say that Timmy wants to kill himself. The utilitarianism approach is to let him? Or is it to help him? I'm phrasing this as a question but really it's a criticism, or maybe I missed something from the text. In the case where not everybody can be happy by choosing either option, who's happiness should we choose? And how do we compare that someone gets to choose it?
