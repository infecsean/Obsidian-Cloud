Question: Aristotle states that philosophy roots from curiosity of the human nature, and while thats nice and cool and all, I cant help but think about whether there is a deeper hole?

Comment: I enjoy the depth that he delves into differentiating wisdom from knowledge.

Criticism: I do not nearly understand the text enough to criticize it. However, I do appreciate the categorization of the four "causes", but I do think that this categorization oversimplifies and disregards the intricate and complex nature of how things happen. Maybe it is the matter of human tendency to see things in order?
