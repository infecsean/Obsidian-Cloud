Question: The author states that people within the echo-chamber would think of outside sources as corrupt or biased, but what if that's actually "true"? Is the right way just to accept outside sources or maybe just take their information with reasonable skepticism?

Comment: I think it is also important to reserve some skepticism for everything so that you won't be dragged into an echo chamber.

Criticism: If performing a reboot rids one of the effects of the echo chamber, the person might become so skeptical of everything to the point of crisis and become paralyzed, not knowing what to trust. I think then, that another prerequisite for this operation is to be in a safe environment.
