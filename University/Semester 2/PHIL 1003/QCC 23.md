Question: Is Bostrom arguing for immortality? If so why, if not, I would think that as long as death exists, humans will never think of life as long enough.

Comment: I love the use of fantastical elements like the king and the kingdom and the big bad dragon. The fact that it was published in the journal of medical ethics gives this story's analogies a rich and delicious context and i love it.

Criticism: I think I agree with one of the people coping with death, that death is maybe a good thing. Arguments like overpopulation, natural human cycle, social inequality because of expensive technology, all that seems to be valid and I realized just now that he actually addressed these in the story.
