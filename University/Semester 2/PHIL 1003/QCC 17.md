Question: Is Johnson arguing that humans need religion to survive?

Comment: I really like how, especially in the passage of “why the search?”, Johnson sort of approached three universal ideas or human tendencies (attraction towards the incomprehensible, insatiable longing for meaning, diverse culture) with the connecting idea of religion and the divine. Not to say that I am religious but I just find it interesting.

Criticism: So Johnson is basically saying that the modern portrayal of god is too distant and ruling, and that religion should go back to honor the depth of traditional theism. Just a thought but maybe we’ve arrived here for a reason, dare I say we matured as humans like a big blob of meat, leading our own lives without the guidance of the divine.
