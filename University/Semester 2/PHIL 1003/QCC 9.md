Question: Socrates' point about death and the reason not to actively seek death is that God does not wish for their death, but here Socrates is being executed by God's "other possessions", am I understanding this wrong?

Comment: I like how Socrates acknowledges all questions and patiently awaits his death.

Criticism: When they verify that it is correct to detach the mind from the body, they recognize that there exists an "absolute beauty and goodness", but aren't those things "values" that we use to navigate the physical world?
