Question: How does Russell know if something is the truth if a belief is based on perspective?

Comment: I like how he differentiated correspondence and coherence and why one works and the other doesn't.

Criticism: Lets say that there's a debate on the existence of aliens. If A says that "since the universe is infinitely large, there must be aliens." but B says that "there is no proof of aliens", both are stating the truth, but they contradict each other. The requirements of truth seems a little contradicting.
