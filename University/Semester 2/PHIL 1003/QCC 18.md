Question: Is Rachels differentiating cultural relativism from morality? Like I feel like he emphasizes morality a little bit too much.

Comment: Interestingly i noticed myself being slightly surprised by the story of the Eskimos killing children then shift back towards understanding once Rachels talks about the reasoning behind it. 

Criticism: Extending my comment, Maybe there is no cultural relativism, at least morally I'm saying, since I only felt disgusted as much as I didn't understand the reasons behind the baby killing. Maybe there are no universal moral codes, but universal principles that guide our thinking.
