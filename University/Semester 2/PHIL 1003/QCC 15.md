Question: In chapter 7, does Freud say that we should give up religion because people are unhappy with civilization? If so, why does he think religion is the problem? If not then oh well.

Comment: I like the passage where he lists out the counterarguments, shows that he's not just trying to prove a point but actually trying to prove a point. "What a lot of accusations all at once!". lovely.

Criticism: On page 29, where Freud talks about the second "attempt" to justify religion, he is going against the belief that "society should keep religion to keep society in order" by arguing that this would undermine the human capacity to basically find meaning themselves. I would say that Freud is undermining the diverse nature of how humans find closure.
