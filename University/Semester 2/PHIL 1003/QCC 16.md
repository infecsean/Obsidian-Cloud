Question: I know Heschel is supporting his religious ideas by the idea of "wonder" as a basis, but is it a justification for religion?

Comment: I feel like Heschel's style of writing is fundamentally more poetic and narrative, which fits well with the topic, but kinda neglects to address the complexities of religion by basing the entire thing on "wonder".

Criticism: Following my comment, I think a fair example is the modern world and its problems. I don't think everything can be solved just by advocating for "wonder", some can only be solved through direct encounters.
