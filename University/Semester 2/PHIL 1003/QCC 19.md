Question: So James argues that morals and religion are independent of each other, but does he argue that morals and religion should be separated?

Comment: I really like this text and how it examines the history of how morals are thought of and it really shows that this really is a hard problem.

Criticism: I don't think I disagree with anything in this text. However, there is one part about the Divine Commandment Theory where I feel like he doesn't necessarily say that the second option, "god's commands are good because he knows so", is wrong, he just kind of, drops it. Maybe im missing something here.
