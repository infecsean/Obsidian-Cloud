Question: If there exists such a concept of the "ultimate good" and hence the "ideal king", isn't it redundant to discuss such unachievable concepts?

Comment: I like how Plato uses the analogy of the line to illustrate the importance of the form of good.

Criticism: If hypothetically, the majority of a city's people exists on the so called "realm" of the lower end, only capable of "imagination", then the philosopher king would be not only detached from reality, but also detached from the people.
