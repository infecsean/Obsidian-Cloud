Step 1: Define a discourse community according to the Melzer reading.
- Common public goals
- Intercommunication between members
- Communication mechanisms that provide information and feedback
- Many genres that help further the goals of community
- Specialized language
- Expert members

Step 2: Make a list of possible discourse communities you belong to
- Game development club
- My math lecture

Step 3: Evaluate each community for the six features of a discourse community.Â 
Game development club
1. Common Public Goal: They said in the club description that everything everyone do here is ultimately to have fun and learn about game development
2. Intercommunication between members: When we are not meeting up in person, we have ways of telling others what we are doing. We use an online platform called Discord which all communication takes place in, from announcements, to parties, and even competitions.
3. Mechanisms that provide info and feedback: We often use our Discord server to ask questions about our own projects and post about work-in-progress things to get feedback from others.
4. Genres that further the goal: In game development, the form of "genre" is the style of games we like to make, whether it's a 2D game, 3D game, first person, third person or otherwise, we are all moving towards the same goal of learning and having fun in learning.
5. Specialized language: The game development community requires the understanding of many technical jargon which could probably be considered specialized language.
6. Expert members: Some people in the community have a lot of experience in the field and would hence be very qualified to lead the community and sometimes give feedback.
Math lecture
1. Common public goal: Learn math to hopefully ascend to the next level of understanding in math.
2. Intercommunication between members: We use Piazza to communicate, or maybe Canvas. Either way we can talk to each other.
3. Mechanisms that provide info and feedback: We regularly make posts on the forums to ask questions about specific math problems.
4. Genres that further the goal: Honestly, there doesn't seem to be a "genre" in math. Math is simply math.
5. Specialized language: I guess you could call the names of equations and symbols a "specialized language" of some sort.
6. Expert members: The teacher and the teaching assistants are all experts in the materials we are learning.

Step 4: Choose a community you will explore for the rest of the semester
I can confidently say that the game development club is definitely the discourse community that I will be exploring for the rest of the semester, not only because it is inherently more interesting, but also because it has more depth.
